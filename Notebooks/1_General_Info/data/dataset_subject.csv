 from holland academic graphics dynamic excursions on weak islands by martin honcoop dynamic excursions on weak island investigates the phenomenon of weak islands within the framework of dynamic semantics . weak islands are contexts that are transparent with respect to some , though not all quantificational dependencies that involve an operator and a variable-expression . specifically , this book explores the consequences of the novel claim that weak islands reduce to the same principles of dynamic semantics that account for inaccessibility . in addition , it examines in both empirical and theoretical terms the precise relationship between the dynamic theory of weak islands and the algebraic semantic approach developed by szabolcsi & zwarts ( 1993 ) . this inquiry leads to a number of further developments of dynamic semantics , such as an intensional version of existential disclosure and an algorithm for computing the dynamic properties of an expression on the basis of its boolean properties . contents : 1 . preamble : a semantic account of weak islands 2 . a dynamic semantics 3 . dynamic binding across weak islands algaebraic versus dynamic perspectives on weak islands 5 . summary and conclusions 1998 . xx + 218 pp . isbn : 90 5569 056 2 . paperback .

 twd98 thinking with diagrams : is there a science of diagrams ? workshop call for participation university of wales , aberystwyth , uk 22-23 august 1998 registration deadline : 22nd july 1998 diagrams are essential in most fields of human activity . there is substantial interest in diagrams and their use in many academic disciplines for the potential benefits they may confer on a wide range of tasks . are we now in a position to claim that we have a science of diagrams ? that is , a science which takes the nature of diagrams and their use as the central phenomena of interest . a science which is attempting to understand how diagrams differ from other representational systems and trying to develop principles for the design of effective graphical representations . a science which considers how diagrams communicate information and how they are used to solve problems . if we have a science of diagrams it is certainly constituted from multiple disciplines , including : cognitive science , psychology , artificial intelligence , logic , mathematics , and others . if there is a science of diagrams , then like other sciences , there is an applications or "" engineering "" discipline that exists alongside the science . applications and engineering provide tests of the theories and principles discovered by the science and extend the scope of the phenomena to be studied by generating new uses of diagrams , new media for presenting diagrams , or novel classes of diagram . this applications and engineering side of the science of diagrams also comprises multiple disciplines , including : education , architecture , computer science , mathematics , human - computer interaction , knowledge acquisition , graphic design , engineering , history of science , statistics , medicine , biology , and others . the theme of twd98 will be - is there a science of diagrams ? by providing a forum for the presentation and discussion of quality research on diagrams and diagram use , we not only try to answer this question , but more importantly attempt draw together the many different approaches , theories and results that we have in the many diverse disciplines that are concerned with diagrams . the question provides a vehicle on which to attempt to integrate what is currently a disparate and disordered set of activities into a more rational and coherent programme of research . is there any common core to the activities which provides a basis for the claim that the twd community could constitute a science ? more information and the workshop registration form can be found at the thinking with diagrams home page : http : / / www . aber . ac . uk / ~ plo / twd98 or contact : patrick olivier ( plo @ aber . ac . uk ) thinking with diagrams ( twd98 ) department of computer science university of wales , aberystwyth ceredigion , uk sy23 3db tel : + 44 1970 622424 / fax : + 44 1970 622455 the twd98 programme will include : ( i ) technical sessions for the presentations of papers ; ( ii ) invited talks on issues relevant to the twd community as a whole ; ( iii ) a panel session on the theme of twd98 . invited presentations : 1 . arthur i miller university college london "" visual representations of nature "" 2 . aaron sloman university of birmingham "" diagrams in the mind ?

16,774,"Subject: qs : laryngeal phonetics
 
 dear colleagues : i have a number of questions regarding laryngeal phonetics . 1 . i understand that english voiced stops are phonetically voiceless unaspirated in initial position . ( data are cited in kingston & diehl 1994 : 432-434 . [ kingston , john , and randy l . diehl , 1994 , phonetic knowledge , _ language _ 70 : 3 . 419-454 . ] ) what is the story about pretonic intervocalic allophones after unstressed , short vowels , e . g . fidelity , legality , mobility ? to my ear they sound the same as in delegate , gallon , billion , but to my english - prejudiced ear they also sound voiced . 2 . what is the story about laryngealization or creaky voice ? i have seen this described as "" a very slow vibration through only one end of the vocal cords "" ( crystal , _ dictionary of linguistics _ ( ? inexact citation ) ) . what are the arytenoid cartilages doing at the posterior end of the vocal folds ? how is it related to the closure for glottal stop and for glottalized consonants ? 3 . what is going on with the articulation of "" stage whispered "" speech ? in whisper , the arytenoids are rotated so as to adduct the posterior ends of the vocal folds at their anterior ends , but the posterior ends of the arytenoids are not themselves adducted by the interarytenoid muscles , leaving a restricted , triangular opening at which sibilant-like turbulence is generated in place of voice . introspecting , stage whisper seems to me to be like whisper only with some turbulence as air passes the closure of the main ( anterior ) portion of the vocal folds . there seems to be somewhat higher subglottal air pressure , like a "" shouted "" whisper , but it does not seem to be merely a question of forcing air past the closed vocal folds . there seem to be some additional differences of articulation to produce the turbulence over the vocal folds , as evidenced at least by increased tension in observable laryngeal and ( to some extent ) pharyngeal muscles . it also seems to me that some degree of pharyngealization is an incidental byproduct . 4 . how is this related to pharyngeal spirants , as exemplified by arabic ? 5 . kingston and diehl ( 1994 : 441 ) say that "" in languages such as english "" ( meaning , i take it , languages without contrastive voiced aspirates ) the phonological distinction [ + / - voice ] is signaled in part by aspiration initially , but not ( if i read them right ) intervocalically . more important , it is said , is the ratio of duration of consonants to duration of vowels , or perhaps the duration of v to vc syllable rimes ( ? ) . can someone say more about this ? these questions bear on characteristics of a language i am working on . in the near term for purposes of defining the issues and refining research strategy , specific information will be more helpful to me than pointers to the literature , because my access to research library resources is not easy ( actually , it 's rather difficult ) , but i will need the pointers too and must of course eventually follow them up . all help will be greatly appreciated . please respond to me and not to the list . if there is interest i will post a summary . bruce nevin bn @ lightstream . com

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered !

"" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was = done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you = go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more = programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , = relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . "" well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 packets , i received $ 58 , 000 with more = coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in about = 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! "" threw it away "" "" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . "" dawn w . , evansville , in "" no free lunch "" "" my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it . ' through trial and error and a somewhat slow frustrating start , i finally figured it out . the program works very well , i just had to find the right target group of people to email it to . so far this year , i have made over $ 63 , 000 using this program . i know my dad would have been very proud of me . "" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 20 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 20 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 20 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 20 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 20 , 000 programs each for a total of 2000 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 20 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , now very legal , money making opportunity . it does = not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and = best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a now perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = 20 to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders !

 dear nlpeople , i ' m sure you ' ll agree auto insurance costs too much . even with a good driving record , "" routine "" rate increases can drive your costs through the roof . i have discovered a way many people can sign up with an excellent company that gives amazingly low rates . they are about half of most of the rates i ' ve found shopping around for insurance in southern california . most people either qualify or have a friend who qualifies who would love to know about it . if you do n't qualify , i have another company that operates in several western states that is cheaper than many companies who claim they have "" the lowest rates available . "" just send $ 2 cash to : pva 1257 n kenmore ave # 2 los angeles , ca 90029 fold it in a piece of paper with your e - mail address and i will rush the information to you right away . if you prefer a hardcopy printout , enclose a self-addressed , stamped envelope . p . s . as a bonus i include two mechanic 's tips that save lots of time on a certain common repair job , and give you a quick and easy way to check the general condition of an engine . i have n't found these in any repair manuals or books before . these are great for home mechanics !

 chomsky 's optimism about "" letting the theory decide "" about unclear cases of grammaticality sharply contrasts with the view proposed by baudrillard ( in _ l ' autre par lui meme _ ) as to the role of theory in forcing reality and in defining us as theory practitioners . i ' m traslating from the spanish version : "" the status of theory could only be one of challenging reality . or , rather , the relationship between the two is one of a mutual challenge . for , undoubtedly , also the real is nothing but a challenge to theory - - not an objective state of affairs , but a radical frontier for analysis , beyond which nothing obeys theory or beyond which theory no longer has anything to say . but also theory is only made to disobey reality , and it constitutes its unreachable frontier . irreconciliation between theory and the real : a corollary of the irreconciliation between subjects and their own goals . all attempts at reconciliation are deceiving and are doomed to failure .

41,1582,"Subject: bilingualism
 
 i ' m not sure why , but i was reluctant to post on the issue of us bilingualism . in any case , i feel obliged to say this as an educational linguist who has worked in esl and tangentially in bilingual ed teacher education . first of all , the entire notion that bilingual ed was , is , or could be ( designed as ) a method for introducing national plurilingualism is a nonstarter . therefore any debates about it using plurilingualism as argument get nowhere . in fact , with out a wish to flame anyone ( because i do n't think it was intentional ) the entire argument that we should stop bilingual ed because of its anti - english or anti-standard english agenda is of a kind very familiar to us in educational circles . it 's little different than what we hear from those who argue that proponents of progressive educational idea x ( e . g . whole langauge reading instruction , process writing , outcomes-based ed . ) are trying to bring down standards , undermine society , do something unamerican , and so on . it is essentially a rhetorical manipulation of the worst kind , based on false suppositions , and intended to push hot buttons . by saying this i am not defending bilingual ed or any other movement . however , i think these need to be debated on their educational merits . why is the argument a nonstarter ? admittedly , there are those in education who propose that students have the right to their own dialect language or what-have - you , and that they should n't have to learn standard english in school . however , they are largely involved in an academic exercise that takes place in the pages of journals of various sorts . they do not shape policy . the avowed purpose of the vast majority of bilingual ed programs is usually to ease a limited english proficient child into the mainstream . the idea is that if they take content area courses in their first language they will not fall behind while learning english . the programs contain esl components that supposedly will allow the kids to mainstream later . some programs do encourage native language literacy and continue classes native language classes throughout a child 's school career . some take very young english speaking kids and put them into these classes on an immersion basis . since usually older english speaking kids in other schools are trying , in theory , to learn the same language the immigrant kids are already fluent in , i fail to see what is controversial about that . it seems to be designed , in theory again , to encourage personal , not societal , bilingualism . the failings of bilingual ed , in places where it has failed , have more to do with poor educational practice than with policy . if kids are arriving at college after say five years in bilingual ed , and are entering esl programs , something did n't work right . to anyone remotely familiar with urban schools , that should hardly be a surprise . now , on a national level i think we should look at us bilingualism and forget about catalonia or the basque country for a moment . bilingualism in the us has endured over many generations in several situations : ( i ) tight - knit religious communities : hasidic jews who speak yiddish , old order amish , brethren , and mennonites , who speak their german dialects . ( ii ) groups who were overtaken , to put it nicely , by english speakers : the navajo and other indigenious peoples ; french creole speakers in louisiana , spanish in the southwest . ( iii ) isolated communities : gullah in south carolina and georgia . immigrants , it would seem , tend to assimilate linguistically over a few , typically very few generations . in spite of the myth that spanish - speakers are somehow different on this score , i think , it would be instructive to look at the case of new york , which is full of people young hispanics who cannot speak more than a few words of spanish - this in spite of continuing immigration from spanish - speaking countries . as a non - yiddish or hebrew speaking ashkanazi jew , i entirely understand this phenomenon although as a learner of spanish as a foreign language , i lament the lost opportunity . finally , i think it would be more instructive to look at which americans feel threatened by the non-existent threat of the demise of something that has never existed ( the us as a monolingual nation ) and try to figure out why people feel that way . why , for example , is it an issue in the west and not in new york ? why is it associated with right and not the left ? why has it come up now again ? is it it really just good old american nativism , ' 90s style , or is there something different going on ? also , why have n't we in linguistics and education done more to communicate with mainstream americans that the whole thing is a lot of nonsense ? michael newman dept . of educational theory & practice the ohio state university mnewman @ magnus . acs . ohio-state . edu

' and i would say ' i ' m a musicolo - gist ' , the next line would be , ' oh ? what instrument do you play ? ' since i was never a particularly good instrumentalist ( or more than a passable singer ) , this always struck me as a somewhat embarrassing question , but i would gamely swing into a brief explanation that musicology was a research , not a performance , activity . nowadays i often get the ' how many languages do you speak ? ' line , which is n't quite as embarrassing because i actually am fairly polyglot , and i admit that , with karl , i appreciate the opportunity to give the brief explanation .

 last week i asked for references to discussions of a problem that comes up in linguistic typology : when there are conflicting or ambiguous criteria for deciding whether a particular language is a particular ' type ' with respect to some feature ( word order , clause alignment , or whatever ) , how does one decide how to assign that language ? i would like to thank the following for their helpful replies : george huttar , yehuda falk , dan everett , larry trask , jon aske , mike maxwell , mark newson , bill croft , georgia green , ingo plag , randy harris , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy . i was quite surprised at the small amount of published attention that there is to this problem . i was pointed to short discussions ( no more than a couple pages ) in some of the major works devoted to typology : the seminal greenberg paper , comrie 's ' language universals and linguistic typology ' , croft 's ' typology and universals ' , and hawkins ' ' word order universals ' . it was also suggested that i look at doris payne 's ' the pragmatics of word order ' and to papers on yagua by payne and dan everett and on tzotzil by judith aissen . what prompted my query was a reading of johanna nichols ' linguistic diversity in space and time , which i found extremely impressive . but all through it i had an uneasy feeling caused by her pigeon-holeing languages as ' svo ' , ' head-marking ' , ' active-stative ' , or whatever . since so many languages are * not * transparently one particular ' type ' on the surface , i wondered what the basis for these type-characterizations was . there is no general answer given to this question for an obvious reason : neither nichols or anyone else could have profound first-hand knowledge of more than a small handful of the 174 languages in the data base . i suspect that in most cases nichols could not know what criteria were applied to type a language in the sources she consulted , because many sources are insufficiently explicit on that point or take as self-evident some categorization that another would take as controversial or simply wrong . ( consider , for example , her typing french as vso . ) there were , to be sure , cases where nichols threw out some language from the sample of some particular feature because of its obvious ambiguous status with respect to that feature . but doing so could have created more problems than it solved . as both aske and croft pointed out in their postings to me , if a language is ' inconsistent ' with respect to a particular feature , that too is typological data ; data moreover that could be highly relevant to conclusions about stability and diversity over time . in a sample of 174 languages , misassignment of several languages within a category with a 3 - way division could lead to rather different conclusions . likewise , so would postulating a different set of categories or having categories specifically for ' mixed ' types . this is beginning to sound like a critique of nichols , but i do n't mean it to be . rather , it is more a commentary on the shaky art of typological pigeon-holeing that underlies not just conclusions about language prehistory , but also much functionalist theorizing and - - increasingly - - generative theorizing as well . there is also the question of sample * size * . typologists strive , quite reasonably , to correct for genetic and areal biases in their samples ( the most heroic effort along these lines that i know of is dryer 's work ) . but how confident can we be of any attempt to eliminate bias from the sample , given nichols ' conclusions that influences can extend half-way around the globe ? and does n't that present a challenge to purported explanations of the relative frequency of some typological feature , which are common in the functionalist literature and increasingly so in the generative ? so much could be the result of historical accident on the one hand and contact and descent on the other , rather than the product of ' external ' functional forces or the design of ug . the smaller the sample of languages where mutual influence or common descent is not a possibility , the more likely that some implicational typological relation is artifactual . and the more reason we have to think that there are a lot of typologically possible but - - purely by chance - - nonexisting languages . fritz newmeyer fjn @ u . washington . edu ps : with respect to the last point , alan bell has shown that if some feature appears in 1 % of the world 's languages ( say , 40-50 languages ) , it will show up only about 50 % of the time in a random sample of 75 languages . you 'd need a sample of over 200 languages before it could be counted on to show up 90 % of the time . and we are assuming here , utterly counterfactually , that there are no genetic relations or areal influences between languages .

 in response to michael newman ( to whom i am very grateful for the references ) , i think that there are two separate issues , are n't there : one is the one he illuminates so well for modern english , namely , the fact that the epicene he biases perceptions in favor of male inter - pretations ; the other is that , even if that were not the case , there would still be something very suspicious about the mere fact that male / masc . pronouns and agreement are used so widely in languages of the world for the epicene . i am not even sure that we can show that the two are related . i would guess that in languages that truly lack gender , one would still find some of the same perceptual biases ( although i am only guessing ) . alexis manaster ramer

 summary of question about numbered examples , etc . in word 2 for windows first of all i want to thank all those who showed me how to number examples in word and gave me other advice . secondly , i want to apologize for not mentioning that i was referring to windows programs , and not mac programs . most people who wrote figured that one out , probably from the version numbers . in what follows , my comments are in square brackets . this was the original question : > i am thinking of moving ( "" migrating "" ? ) from wordperfect 6 to ms word > 6 , which came bundled with my new computer , and would like to know if people > with similar experiences have anything of interest to say about such a move , > such as for example any good references to look into ( that are not too basic ; > the software did n't come with a reference manual , just the online manual ) . > > two specific questions : > > 1 ) numbered examples : wp can set up counters , which is how i dealt with > numbered examples . word does n't seem to have a similar > capability ? could that be possible ? how do people deal with automatic > numbering of examples in word ( as well as cross-references to examples ) ? > > 2 ) file manager : this is something where wp is better than word by a long > shot , but i understand there are add-ons for word out there . has anybody > heard of this ? > > 3 ) search software : while i ' m at it , i just got a message about a software > utility called powersearch , by commtech , which has powerful search mechanisms > and works in word or wordperfect ( there are two versions ) . has anyone had > any experience with this ? ( it is obtainable with ftp ) . windows vs . mac [ there are more than twice as much pcs out there than mac 's , but perhaps among linguists the percentages are more even . i ' m not ready to change though . i am quite happy with pcs thank you very much . ] you do n't say whether you ' re a mac or pc person , but the reviews of word 6 for mac were uniformly enormously negative : they actually ported woindows onto the mac ! since we mac users continually have to escape the really lousy windows imitations of things the mac does gracefully , we can't imaging why they did that ! the macuser review recommended nisuswritier as the word processor of choice now ( and if you are evern going to use alien scripts , there 's no substitute ) ; but you shluld also look at framemaker ( abvailable for lots of platforms , ioncluding windows ) ; it can number an idefinitely large number of different series , cross-refer between chapters that are separate files , etc . it only is n't woldscript - sensitive . ( version 4 . 0 . 4 was sort of , but was buggy , and in the just-released version 5 , they abancdoned it . ) wordperfect vs . word [ the advantage of wp for linguists is definitely the special characters it supports , though the special fonts that come with wp ( which are true type ) will work , i believe , with word , so word users can get a hold of these true type fonts from their wp user friends . ] i am in a similar situation : my new office computer came with microsoft office , which includes word . i toyed with the idea of switching from word perfect , but after a minimal amount of tinkering with word , i have about abandoned the idea . the main reason , for me , is that word perfect comes with a fairly extensive set of special characters , which i use a lot . they include several foreign alphabets , most of the ipa alphabet , characters for logical notation , and so forth . word , as far as i can tell , comes with hardly any of these . so i have about decided to erase office from my hard drive and install what i really use . numbered examples [ word can indeed number examples or anything at all . the terminology is a bit different though , which is why i was confused . in wp you set up counters , but in word you set up sequences . ] [ several people told me that they had gotten this to work , though they did n't all know how they did it . however , after they pointed me in the right direction , i was able to figure it out . ] you set up a counter by using the seq field ( look in your manual under fields ) . fields are somewhat like codes in wordperfect , they have links to things like counters ( chapter number , section , number ) or dates , file names , etc . one of the fields is seq . ( a ) chose : insert / field , click seq , which will give you a seq in the bottom window ; add "" ex / n "" to the right of the seq code in lower window , press return ( the ex is the name or identifier for the counter , the / n is to increase the number by 1 ) . the first time you do this a 1 will show up , the second a 2 , etc . ( you can set up more than one such counter / sequence by giving each sequence a diferent name an identifier ) ( there are many predefined sequences , e . g . { seq chapter } refers to chapter numbers . ) ( b ) you can create a macro , which then you can assign to a button or a key combination , which does : 1 ) choose a paragraph type you ' ve created which has the right margins , font size , etc . for your example paragraph ; and 2 ) right tab , ( , the stuff in ( a ) above , ) , left tab . ( c ) cross - referencing examples : very easy . first you have to create a bookmark for an example you want to cross-reference : a ) highlight the number created in ( a ) above ( along with the parentheses ) . b ) choose edit / bookmark , give the bookmark a name ( 40 characters ) , e . g . donkey _ sentence c ) when you want to refer to it , you type , e . g . , "" as we saw in example "" ; then you click insert / cross - reference , click bookmark , click the name of the bookmark , click insert . of course , many of these operations can be simplified with macros . there are many possibilities that i have n't mentioned . for instance , if you want to number the examples in ch . 3 in the format ( 3 . 1 ) , all you have to is before you insert the field for seq , you insert the field for the chapter . ] help on numbering in word 2 came from : numbering examples in dos : you are right , the automatic numbering of examples in word ( . 4 , . 5 & . 6 ) is inexistant which is a problem for linguists since we deal with a lot of examples in our text . if this can be of any interst for you i have found an excellent programm which allows me to do automatic numbering of examples as well as cross-references to examples in the text . the name of the program is renumber 1 . 2 and you can get it by writing to : jonathan mead ; 356 no . spaulding ave . ; los angele , ca ; usa 90036 or by e-mailing jonathan at : izzyt09 @ uclamvs i have been told that the fees for this programm are $ 15 . for student and $ 20 . for non student . [ i have used renumber in the past , and it works well . it is not as convenient as the features in word and wordperfect though . ] powerful searches if you are a mac user and are looking for super-sophisticated searching , try nisus which uses grep conventions and is the best going that i know of . regarding your 's earch ' question , there is a * lot * of stuff available out there , depending on the scope of your intended use . . . . if you ' re just going for personal use on 1 pc , you may want to look at eclipse find , not free , but only $ 99 , last time i looked . ( just my $ 0 . 02 ) . [ powersearch seems to be pretty nice . i downloaded it from simtel ( ftp oak . oakland . edu , cd simtel / win3 / winword ( or cd simtel / win3 / wpwin ) , and get the compressed binary file powersch . zip ( or searchwp . zip ) . unfortunatel this version has the powerful features locked , and to unlock them you have to send in $ 50 , which i have not done . the search possibilities seem pretty impressive . trees huge advantage if you would make use of it is that you can easily draw trees , using the integral drawing program ( from what people say , it sounds better than arboreal ) . i keep a little file of tree-parts . reference books [ i should say that the microsoft office professional cd-rom which came wih my computer does have all the manuals in it . af first , i was n't too excited about these electronic books , but now that i ' ve gotten used to the idea , it 's not so bad . ] books : i have borland 's running word 6 . it is fairly adequate . but it does not explain about styles and templates sufficiently , to my mind ( admittedly somewhat addled ) and it does not have enough information about long documents ( master documents ) . the index is useless , until you already know what you want to find out . the help system is extensive , though again it is sometimes hard to know what to ask it . depending on your learning style , you may be quite handicapped without a real manual , but happily there are commercial versions available at most bookstores "" prima visual learning guide for word 6 . 0 "" ( prima publishing , po box 1260bk rocklin , ca 95677 ) is an example . on the other hand , it is good to get used to the on-line help , because it 's always there . file managers what do you want to do ? delete files ? view files ? create directories ? windows file manager , while not the best option , offers much of this function , just a mouse click away . also , try word 's find file command ( under the file menu ) i was real happy when i figured out how to do this one : i knew you could look at a file in wp without opening it , but i was not sure how to do this in word : here 's how : from the file menu , choose find file . select the file whose contents you want to view . if you do n't see the file you are looking for , search for it : click on the search button , choose the drive and directory ( s ) you want to look in , make a wildcard filename ( like * . rev ) choose include subdirectories ( if you want to check your whole drive , etc ) , click on ok , and look at the list of files found . to preview the file , select preview in the view box ( still in the find file dialog box . then just click on the filename you want to look at , and you will see the first page on the screen . you can scroll through it to browse , you can delete , copy , open etc . by choosing the commands button . - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - jon aske home address : bates college 12 bardwell st . lewiston , maine 04240 , usa lewiston , maine 04240-6336 e-mail : jaske @ abacus . bates . edu - phone / fax : ( 207 ) 786-0589 - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = -

 dear subscribers , recently i came across an example of better used without had in the following construction : she better stop . as it was an american publication , i assumed that the use of had in such expressions had completely disappeared , in written as well as spoken us english . i would not have been surprised to find that it had disappeared from spoken usage , since there are obvious phonological reasons , but the loss of it in writing indicated to me that the use of better alone was quite standardised . this poses a question for me , and i was wondering if anyone out there has a suggestion . if it is now standardised , and there is no longer a had , why does n't the former bare infinitive stop now become finite and take 3ps inflection ( ? she better stops ) ? is this because it now has assumed a subjunctive-like quality ? can it then be associated with the expression : it is better that she stop ? if so , can another adjective be substituted for better here , e . g . it is good that she stop ) ? ? she good stop ? how has this been reanalysed , and what are the implications ? ( susan dopke informs me that some grammarians have interpreted better in these contexts as an auxiliary , and if that is the case , can we use sub-aux inversion to make it a question ? ( ? better she stop ? ) is this now acceptable too ? please send your suggestions if this bothers you . debbie ziegeler

 alexis manaster ramer asks about the claim that relatedness and / or subgrouping should be established only based on systematic morphological relationships of the sort likely to be observed in paradigms or declensions . i ' m familiar with this claim only in a much weaker form , that morphological comparisons are more reliable than phonological ones as a basis for establishing linguistic relationships and subgroups . on this basis , for example , robert hetzron in 1976 * proposed a rigorous internal subgrouping for the semitic languages based on affixes in the verb paradigms . hetzron 's proposal that hebrew , arabic , and aramaic constitute a central semitic group is , i believe , correct ; and it is supported by much more evidence than hetzron adduces , much of it morphological and morpho-syntactic ( e . g . , innovation of novel negative markers , etc . ) . i may be reading too much into these claims of morphological priority in establishing subgrouping , but i have always interpreted them as a reaction to the difficulty of distinguishing convergent from shared phonological development on a principled basis . that is , because it can be difficult to determine whether a particular recurrent sound change in a language group represents shared innovation rather than convergent development , it might be pragmatically safer to rely on morphological innovation . thus , in the case of the semitic languages , such changes as * p to / f / or * g to / jh / ( as in junk ) would , if treated as shared innovation , lead to subgroups that are inconsistent with those deduced by other means . on the other hand , "" unusual "" changes like the change of proto - semitic glottalic consonants to pharyngealized consonants are much more likely to represent shared innovation , given the typological rarity of pharyngealized consonants . with regard to fritz newmeyer 's questions about comparative syntactic reconstruction , i do n't know of any systematic published counters to jeffers ' ( and others ' ) claims that it is * in principle * impossible . however , i think that a good case can be made that this is an overly pessimistic assessment . the problem , of course , is the appropriate context : we compare phonemes in words and / or morphemes and morphemes in paradigms , but it 's not clear what the context might be for word orders . presumably discourse context plays a role . i would imagine that if all the languages in a family shared an unusual word order ( vis a vis their dominant types , whatever those might be ) in counterfactuals , we might want to attribute that order to their latest shared ancestor . pragmatically speaking , it 's a lot easier to find information about the morphological context of particular phonemes than it is to find reliable information about the larger context for sentence and construction types . nonetheless , at least inchoately ( and perhaps it is the inchoateness that jeffers objects to ) , * some * notion of syntactic reconstruction is surely behind claims that proto - indo - european was sov or proto - semitic was svo , and the like . * "" two principles of genetic reconstruction "" , lingua 38 : 89-104 . alice faber faber @ haskins . yale . edu

 reminder - - deadline is july 1 1998 call for submissions machine translation special issue on spoken language translation guest editor : steven krauwer ( utrecht university ) guest editorial board : doug arnold ( university of essex ) pascale fung ( hkust , hong kong ) walter kasper ( dfki , saarbrucken ) alon lavie ( cmu , pittsburgh ) lori levin ( cmu , pittsburgh ) hermann ney ( rwth , aachen ) harold somers ( umist , manchester ) some 15 years ago , when machine translation had become fashionable again in europe , few people would be prepared to consider seriously embarking upon spoken language translation research . after all , where both machine translation of written text , and speech understanding and production ( despite important achievements ) were still quite far from showing robustness in domain-independent applications , it seemed clear that putting three not even halfway understood technologies together would be premature , and bound to fail . since then , the world has changed . many researchers , both in academia and in industry , have taken up the challenge to build systems capable of translating spoken language . does that mean that most of the problems involved in speech-to - text , text-to - text translation , and text-to - speech have been solved ? the answer is no : although we have made a tremendous progress , both from a scientific and from a technological point of view , many of the fundamental problems in mt and in speech understanding remain unsolved . yet a certain degree of optimism is justified here . first of all , it is clear that on the whole general expectations of what mt will do are changing . where in the past the ultimate goal of mt seemed to be to provide a perfect , but cheaper and faster alternative to the human translator , there is now a clear shift from the ideal of fully automated high quality translation of unrestricted texts to the more practical problem of overcoming the language barriers we encounter in various situations . this shift of focus allows us to partition the problem we address into a series of smaller ones , the solution to which may be within our reach . this applies both to spoken and written language translation . if we look at spoken communication between human beings with different native languages , very often the main success criterion for this communication is not whether or not the individual utterances produced by the participants have been expressed or understood without errors ( which will rarely be the case ) , but rather whether the intended goal of the communication has been attained ( hotel room reservation , airline information , etc ) . this observation is extremely important when we try to set our goals for spoken translation systems . once we have realized that communication takes place in a specific context , with a specific goal , and have accepted that sentence-by - sentence linguistically correct translation is not a necessary condition for successful multilingual communication , we can start exploiting the full potential of spoken dialogues in human-human and human-machine interaction : the basic structure of dialogues , the ways to control dialogue flow , the possibility for repair . a workshop dedicated to spoken language translation , organized in conjunction with eacl / acl 1997 in madrid , showed that there was a keen interest in the topic , and that many acedemic and industrial research teams have interesting results to report . therefore we feel that the time has come to dedicate a special issue of the journal machine translation to this topic , and we are inviting high-quality , previously unpublished research papers addressing problems in the whole field of spoken language translation . ( note : authors who had papers accepted for the madrid workshop are especially encouraged to submit papers which have developed out of their workshop contributions , though they should note that we do not intend simply to reprint the workshop papers in their original form . ) we are especially interested in papers addressing problems or solutions that are typical for spoken language translation ( as opposed to written language translation ) . format for submission : please consult the journal 's web pages : home page : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / journalhome . htm / 0922-6567 instructions for authors : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / kaphtml . htm / ifa0922-6567 latex style files : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / jrnlstyle . htm / 0922-6567 articles should be submitted directly to the publishers , either by e-mail to ellen . klink @ wkap . nl , with the subject header "" submission to coat speech special issue "" , or in hard-copy to either of the following addresses : machine translation editorial office , machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 990 , p . o . box 230 3300 az dordrecht , accord , ma 02018-023 the netherlands u . s . a . the journal is typeset using latex , so the preferred medium for submission of articles in electronic format is latex source ( using the kluwer style file ) or gzipped postscript . if submitting hard-copy , four copies of the paper are required . the length of the papers should be approximately 10-20 pages if using the kluwer style file ( around 20k words ) . authors are requested to send a copy of an abstract of not more than 200 words to the guest editor steven . krauwer @ let . ruu . nl or in hard-copy to steven krauwer , utrecht institute of linguistics ots , trans 10 , 3512 jk utrecht , the netherlands submission deadline : submissions and abstracts should be received by july 1 1998 . papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the editorial board . we are aiming for publication as issue 3 or 4 of volume 13 ( autumn or winter , 1998 ) .

 hi all , does anyone know of a language in which passives are more frequent than actives ? it seems that it is possible to find languages in which actives are more frequent than passives , and even languages in which passives do not exist , but does the third case occur in any natural language ? any help on this would be greatly appreciated ? ll

102,834,"Subject: rate of loss for "" basic "" vocabulary
 
 some months ago there was an extended discussion of the proposal made in the fifties by swadesh that there are certain lists of meanings which have the property that the words expressing them are lost at a fairly constant rate per millennium in all languages , in particular , a certain 100 - meaning list where the rate is around 86 % . while noting that bergsland and vogt have adduced examples where the rate seems to be lower , i pointed out that i had not found any examples where it was clearly higher . jacques guy referred to the eastern greenlandic data discussed by bergsland and vogt in current anthropology in 1962 , but , having just carefully read this paper , i see that they state that , while they surmise that the rate here was higher , they cannot calculate what is was ( presuumably because there are no sources for greenlandic that are old enough ) . moreover , the purely conjectural rate of 72 % which they mention is still low enough for the purposes of the original discussion we were having about this , namely , to assure that in a family with enough ramification there would be a substantial portion of the original vocabulary reflected in at least two descendants after far more than 10 , 000 years ( provided each language was independely losing 28 % of the original vocabulary per millennium ) . i do n't have the numbers handy , but jacques , who is better at this anyway , can probably whip some up . but i should also add that bergsland nd vogt 's data are also consistent with many other assumptions , notably , that the rate of retention in e . greenlandic was 86 % , but that it was substanitally lower in some other eskimo languages ( because all they have is the result that e . greenlandic is as different lexically from w . greenlandic as the two together are from yupik , which makes no sense given the family tree if the rates are the same eveywhere ) . but this could be due to slower vocabulary loss in yupik ( or even in the common ancestror of e . and w . greenlandic , or both ) just as well as to faster loss in e . greenlandic . so there is no justification that i can find for bergsland and vogt 's or guy 's assumption that the "" prolem "" lies in a faster rate of loss in e . greenlandic .

111,1045,"Subject: summary of names of days
 
 dear linguists , in the december 15 issue of linguist i posted a request for examples of deictic expressions for the names of days either side of "" today "" . here is the summary of what i obtained . the response was overwhelming - a total of 70 linguist subscribers sent replies . many , many thanks to all of you who contributed . quite a number of respondents supplied information on two or more languages . there was some duplication of languages , namely japanese , mandarin chinese , danish , french , german , russian and hindi . i now have examples of 48 languages , they are : anejom ( vanuatu ) , a = fee a = fee ( solomon is ) , azerbaijani turkish , basque , bauan ( standard fijian ) , brazilian portuguese , bulgarian , czech , danish , dutch , english , erromagan ( vanuatu ) , estonian , finnish , french , german , hausa , hawai ` ian , hindustani , ipili ( png ) , italian , japanese , kamhmu ? ( vietnam ) , ki - swahili , kope ( png ) , korean , lao / phasa iisaan , lenakel ( vanuatu ) , madarin chinese , malay , mauritian / seychelles creole , modern greek , modern hebrew , norwegian , polish , quechua , rumanian , russian , samoan , serbo - croatian , slovene , sulka ( png ) , swedish , taiwanese , thai , welsh . my original interest in collecting such deictic expressions stems from a general interest in symmetry in language and language systems . most languages exhibit a symmetry in the number of deictic expressions for diurnal units either side of "" today "" , however , some exhibit an asymmetry . c . s . levinson ( pragmatics , 1983 : 75 ) reports , "" the amerindian language chinantec has four named days either side of today ; japanese has three days back from today , and two ahead ; hindi has the same word for yesterday and tomorrow . "" ( levinson gleaned this information from : fillmore , c . j . ( 1975 ) . santa cruz lectures on deixis , 1971 . mimeo , indiana university linguistics club . ) i have not personally been able to get a hold of this the fillmore reference - living in the academically isolated south seas does have some drawbacks ! if any of you have a copy of this publication , i would be very interested in obtaining photocopies of the section on ` time deixis ' . of course , i will reimburse you for the cost of postage and photocopying . anyway , a symmetrical deictic system of diurnal units / spans seems to me logical , though i ' m not sure i can verbalise the reasons . the reported asymmetry in the japanese system seemed to me a bit odd . especially that the asymmetry was lop-sided towards the past ( see below for reasons ) . upon further examination , i discovered that the japanese deictic system for diurnal units does seem to be symmetrical ; it has + 3 and - 3 either side of the present diurnal span . the expression ` siasatte / yanoasatte ' meaning + 3 days from "" today "" is not known to quite an number of native speakers of japanese . they appear to be used infrequently and ` yanoasatte and yaneasatte ' are considered to be dialectal ( at least in relation to the tokyo dialect ) . indeed , the lecturer in japanese in my department ( herself a native speaker of japanese ) was not aware of these expressions until she looked them up in her dictionary . another interesting consideration in all of this is the question as to the number of diurnal units before and after today that languages recognise . what is the maximum / minimum number of units ? also , what is the average number of units ( or most popular system ) ? answers to these questions ( based on my small sample ) below . one respondent asked the following very interesting question : "" if you reach the level of , let 's say , 5 ( days after present diurnal span ) , does this also have the non-specific reading ` at some point in the not-to - far-away future ' in those languages ? "" the only language in my small corpus that has + 5 and - 5 diurnal units in its system is erromangan ( vanuatu ) . i will have to ask my source for erromangan to answer this question . there is an inherent problem in determining the number expressions for diurnal units . this is determining whether the expressions are lexemes or phrases . many languages seem to have "" lexicalised "" ( for want of a better term ) prepositional / nominal phrases . other languages , like for example the english expression ` the day before yesterday ' , have retained the phrase structure . one respondent supplied me with a lengthy discussion on the lexeme / phrase issue . she cites the case of bulgarian ( i hope she won't mind my including her discussion here ) : [ begin quote ] bulgarian presents an [ interesting ] situation with regard to the phrase / lexeme issue because it does n't have a real nominal case paradigm : onzi den - 2 ( lit . "" that / yonder day "" ) vchera - 1 dnes 0 present diurnal span utre + 1 vdrugi den + 2 ( lit . "" other day "" ) so the same form ' pozavchera ' in bulgarian ( with stress on the penultimate syllable ; russian ' pozavchera ' has stress on the final syllable ) perhaps does n't look as strange because one would n't expect ' po ' to require any particular case ending . however , again we have what looks like a preposition with an adverb , which should not exist as a phrase . bulgarian "" tomorrow "" is ' utre ' . but "" the day after tomorrow "" is ' vdrugiden ' - - i . e . , the phrase ' v drugi den ' ( lit . "" on ( the ) other day "" , written without spaces in between the individual words . should this be considered a word simply on orthographic grounds , though ? is it a prepositional phrase or an adverb ? of course the boundary between prepositional phrases and adverbs is very fuzzy to begin with . bulgarian "" the day before yesterday "" , in contrast , is what looks like a noun phrase : ' onja den ' - - "" that day "" . no preposition ' v ' ( "" on "" ) here . so should this be considered just an np or a prepositional phrase ? ' onja den ' is used the same way as ' vdrugiden ' - - ' vidjax go onja den ' - - "" i saw him [ on ] the day before yesterday "" . it seems to me that what 's written as a noun phrase here is really an adverb , like ' vdrugiden ' or like russian ' pozavchera ' and ' poslezavtra ' , the only difference being that the other three adverbs are formed from prepositional phrases while ' onja den ' has no preposition . it would sound strange to call it a prepositional phrase , because , unlike ' vdrugiden ' , it contains no preposition . so i would call it an adverbial phrase . ( time expressions in slavic languages are commonly in the accusative , and that may be the origin of ' onja den ' , but since modern bulgarian has lost its nominal case paradigm for the most part this makes it harder to determine the status of phrases like this one . ( cf . russian ' kazhduju nedelju ' ( "" each - acc week - acc "" ) , which means "" every week "" in an adverbial sense . ) bulgarian does n't have specific words for "" the day before the day before yesterday "" - - that would be , i think , ' v denja predi onja den ' ( "" on the day before the day before yesterday "" ) , but of course speakers would avoid that and just would say ' predi dva dena ' ( "" two days ago "" , lit . "" before two days "" ) . the same would be true for ' vdrugiden ' - - ' v denja sled vdrugiden ' is conceivably possible ( "" on the day after the-day - after-tomorrow "" ) , but speakers would say 's led dva dena ' ( "" in / after two days "" ) . so i think it may be very difficult here to draw a demarcation line here between the grammatical categories of words vs . phrases . [ end of quote ] quite a number of languages ( especially slavonic and germanic languages ) allow recursion of prepositions / prefixes to "" add on "" to the already existing deictic expressions . the extent to which this recursion can be practiced is limited only by pragmatic constraints . here are some nice examples : rumanian : ras-ras - ras-alaltaieri ( ? ) - 5 ras-ras - alaltaieri ( ? ) - 4 ras-alaltaieri - 3 alaltaieri - 2 ieri - 1 azi / astazi 0 present diurnal span miine + 1 poimiine + 2 ras-poimiine + 3 ras-ras - poimiine ( ? ) + 4 ras-ras - ras-poimiine ( ? ) + 5 etc . dutch : ( eer-eergisteren ) + 3 eergisteren + 2 gisteren - 1 vandaag 0 present diurnal span morgen + 1 overmorgen + 2 ( over-overmorgen ) + 3 danish : ( i for-forgars - 3 ) i forgars - 2 i gar - 1 i dag 0 present diurnal span i morgen + 1 i overmorgen + 2 ( i over-overmorgen + 3 the - 3 and + 3 forms are rather colloquial , but nevertheless perfectly idiomatic . further recursions of prefixes / prepositions are only used in jocular ways , and predominantly by children . finally , if you have read this far , you are about to be rewarded with a summary of the data i have at this point . number of diurnal units either side of "" today "" : symmetrical deictic systems - 1 0 + 1 no examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 23 examples - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 14 examples - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 3 examples - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - erromangan ( vanuatu ) asymmetrical deictic systems - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 3 examples - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 1 example - malay - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 1 example - hausa - 3 - 2 - 1 0 + 1 + 2 1 example - colloquial spanish ( southern spain ) it 's interesting to note that no language in the sample employs the - 1 0 + 1 system . and the majority of asymmetrical systems are lop-sided towards the + side of the present diurnal span . why this should be so , i do n't know . however , this sample is very small and perhaps a larger sample would show no such lop-sidedness towards the + "" today "" side . are the languages that show a lop-sidedness in a state of change ? most languages have a symmetrical vowel system e . g . the same number of front vowels as back vowels . however , there are quite a number of languages with asymmetrical vowel systems . what lies behind this asymmetry ? the answer to this question may lie in the following scenario [ from : crowley , t . ( 1992 ) an introduction to historical linguistics , oup , pp . 200-201 ] suppose that in a language with a nice symmetrical five vowel system : i u e o a the vowel / e / beocomes raised towards / i / and ultimately merges merges with / i / . the resulting asymmetrical system : i u o a will put structural pressure on the system , and , in time , it would not be surprising to see / o / merging with / u / . if a system becomes asymmetrical ( or uneven ) so as to create some sort of ` gap ' , then a change is likely to take place as a way of plugging that ` gap ' , thereby re-establishing an even ( or symmetrical ) system . if this is indeed a natural process in phonological systems , perhaps analogous processes occur in other systems , like temporal deictic systems . a language with an asymmetrical temporal deictic system may be in the process of historical change and the ` gap ' plugged in due time . japanese may be a language that is in the process of losing its + 3 deictic term . if this is indeed the case , it would be interesting to see whether , in due course , this "" imbalance "" is "" balanced "" again by the loss of its - 3 deictic term . i do n't know how valid any of this is , i ' m just speculating . anyway , back to symmetry . the most symmetrical system of all is that found in hindi : tarso - 4 narso - 3 parso - 2 kal - 1 aaj 0 present diurnal span kal ( bihaan ) + 1 parso + 2 narso + 3 tarso + 4 where there are not only an equal number expressions for diurnal units either side of "" today "" , but the expressions on either side are the same . distinction between "" before today "" and "" after today "" is made through use of past or future tense of the verb . in looking at a language 's temporal deictic system i guess we must not fail to take account of a number of important linguistic / cultural aspects . among these would be : * the culture 's view of time . is it a linear view or a cyclical view ? * the language 's tense / aspect systems . * the historical development of its deictic expressions in short , we can't study deictics in isolation . we must look at how it meshes grammatically with the language . i would be very interested in any of your views on the reasons for symmetry and asymmetry we find in this area of deixis . also , if you are interested in adding to my list of languages , i 'd be very grateful to receive your contribution . thanks again to all those generous people who sent me so much interesting data and opinions . yours today , tomorrow and . . . jan tent department of literature and language school of humanities the university of the south pacific p . o . box 1168 suva fiji tel : ( 679 ) 313900 ext . 2263 fax : ( 679 ) 305053 e - mail : tent _ j @ usp . ac . fj = 09

 hello , my name is kevin elphick and i am the managing director of nursing innovations which have been manufacturing and supplying a range of innovative wound dressing protectors named ' keep - dri dressings ' to australian hospitals for a period in excess of 8 years . these internationally award winning products are now extensively used in over 70 % of western australian hospitals ( references available upon request ) and we are now looking at supplying to hospitals internationally . however , we have found from experience it is difficult to initially introduce the product to hospitals . once a hospital starts using keep - dri dressings they have always continued to use them . our success is related to the fact that they are quick and easy to apply ( saving staff time ) and they really work . the result is lower infection risk , reduced patient trauma and lower cost for the hospital . for your free sample contact me at my web site http : / / www . angelfire . com / ca2 / nursingone here you will find a full product description , uses and advantages and a link to my email address . i would appreciate any suggestions you might have to help introduce this excellent product into hospitals in your area or comments you have on our product . many thanks in advance . kevin elphick nursing innovations 23 yulema street mullaloo , perth , western australia 6027 618-9487 - 1807 http : / / www . angelfire . com / ca2 / nursingone * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * k

 the three books listed below are in the linguist office and now available for review . if you are interested in reviewing a book ( or leading a discussion of the book ) ; please contact our book review editor , andrew carnie , at : carnie @ linguistlist . org note : please include in your request message a brief statement about your research interests , background , affiliation and other information that might be valuable to help us select a suitable reviewer . do not provide a link or url to an online cv or homepage - - these will be ignored . please also provide a surface address for us to send the book to . phonology : james m . scobbie ; autosegmental representation in a declarative constraint - based framework 0-8153 - 1949 - 0 , cloth ; 280 pages , $ 61 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics the book examines the formal characterization of multiple association from the perspective of a declarative constraint-based phonological framework . both the autosegmental and constraint-based aspects of the book are highly relevant to recent developments in phonological theory , predating the current interest in constraint interaction and optimization . inspired by the empirical and formal success of unification - based grammars , all phonological rules and representations are interpreted as hard constraints on well-formedness . in general then , constraints are simply conjoined , and faithfulness to the lexical entry is obligatory . alternations arise from underspecification . the multiple sequenced tiers of autosegmental phonology are shown to be redundant , and linear order is limited to the root tier . association is then defined as the inverse of dominance within the feature geometry , so multiple association is co-dominance of a feature by two roots . the no crossing constraint is not applicable since non-root features are not on sequenced tiers , and the sharing constraint is introduced instead as the key means of forcing locality on co-dominance : it bans co-dominance by non - adjacent roots . thus , because features and association lines are indestructible , the key autosegmental properties of integrity and inalterability are predicted to occur . long distance dependencies are then considered . from the perspective of structural integrity , discontinuous geminates in planar morphologies are more like fake geminates than true geminates , which is predicted by the sharing constraint . only a tiny amount of nontonal data can be presented in favor of non-local multiple association which feeds phonological rules : chaha displays non-local inalterability and javanese , the opposite ( side-effects ) . thus the balance of evidence is against a single mechanism uniting local and non-local multiple association . phonology daniel silverman ; phasing and recoverability ; 0-8153 - 2876 - 1 , cloth ; 256 pages , $ 56 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this phonological study investigates the articulatory timing ( "" phasing "" ) relationships that render acoustic cues optimally recoverable by the listener , and the strong tendency for languages to allow sub-optimal timing patterns only if they allow optimal ones . the primary area of focus is the otomanguean language group of oaxaca , mexico and neighboring states , which possesses "" laryngeally complex "" vowels , a typologically unusual pattern in which tone and non-modal phonatory settings ( breathiness , creakiness ) cross-classify . the laryngeally complex vowels of jalapa mazatec , comaltepec , chinantec , and copala trique are studied in depth . also explored are the phasing relations between obstruents and laryngeals , and sonorants and laryngeals , including phonological analyses from such diverse groups as mon - khmer , tibeto - burman , and nilotic , among others . throughout the investigation , findings from a number of relevant disciplines aerodynamics , acoustics , audition are applied to the sound patterns in an effort not only to describe them in phonetic detail , but also to explain their phonological and typological behavior .

 john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to a new series ; studies in corpus linguistics studies in corpus linguistics aims to provide insights into the way a corpus can be used , the type of findings that can be obtained , the possible applications of these findings as well as the theoretical changes that corpus work can bring into linguistics and language engineering . the main concern of scl will be to present findings based on , or related to , the cumulative effect of naturally occurring language and on the interpretation of frequency and distributional data . general editor : elena tognini - bonelli consulting editor : wolfgang teubert terms in context jennifer pearson 1998 xii , 246 pp . studies in corpus linguistics , 1 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 342 4 price : us $ 69 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 2269 x price : nlg 138 john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com terms in context applies the methodology that has been developed over the last two decades in corpus linguistics to the relatively new and still little developed field of corpus-based terminography . while corpora are already being used by some terminologists fro the identification of terms and retrieval of contextual fragments , his book describes the first attempt to use corpora for terminography in much the same way as large general reference corpora are already being used for general language lexicography . the author goes beyond the standard problem of identifying terms , as opposed to non-terminological lexical items in text and focuses on identifying metalanguage patterns which point to the presence in text of ( parts of ) reusable definitions of terms . the author examines these and shows how the information which they contain can be retrieved and used as input for terminological entries . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bernadette martinez - keck tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 publicity / marketing fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 john benjamins north america e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com

 i am writing to ask alexis manaster ramer a simple question concerning the universality of certain phenomena : how come about a hundred languages are spoken in present-day russia despite the attempts to russify everyone ? this linguist seems to be very active , yet unfortunately he tends to generalize the information he is aware of , judging by his contribution to the discussion on he / she pronouns and his remarks concerning russian linguistic policies . i would like to tell him of a common example concerning various ethnicities in russia : in 1553 czar ivan the dreadful incorporated the mari , mordvin ( finnic ) , chuvash and tatars ( turkic ) nationalities into his state . nowadays these peoples live in the very heart of russia on the middle volga , and , apparently , enjoy their culture and languages . they have also contributed to the culture and language of the dominant nation . the infamous cossacks ( farmers living on the borders of the state and ready to resort to arms to protect them , a sort of michigan militia ) have preserved their language while acquiring a lot of culture from , say , mountaineers of the caucausus . yet they did not assimilate those peoples who still speak their languages . to draw parallels between nostratic universal processes and the language policies of russia might hardly be considered an appropriate example . it would rather be the opposite of the desired . valeri vassiliev st . john 's

 what numerical and alphabetic codes have been established for representing languages and dialects in computer databases and computerized information exchange ? is there an international standard for representing the language ( and dialect ) of a spoken utterance ( as opposed to the written form ) . the best that i have found is the three-character alphabetic code used by the cornell - sil language archive as published in ethnologue by wycliffe bible translators , inc . however , it does not have the status of an international standard and does not have a corresponding numerical form that is published . ideally the standard numerical form would use 13 bits to represent the 5445 languages described . this would leave 3 bits out of two bytes to reference up to 8 dialects . the international organization for standardization does publish two relevant standards but neither attempts to represent spoken languages directly . the standard iso 639 : 1988 is a "" code for the representation of the names of languages . "" it uses two alphabetic characters to represent only 136 languages and does not distinguish the various spoken forms of chinese ( mandarin , cantonese , etc . ) . the standard iso 3166 : 1988 is a "" code for the representation of the names of countries .

 second call for papers effects of morphological case workshop to be held at the utrecht institute of linguistics ots , utrecht university , 28-29 august 1998 . organizers : helen de hoop , olaf koeneman , iris mulders , and fred weerman invited speakers : paul kiparsky , joan maling , alec marantz the aim of this workshop is to investigate the effects of morphological case that go beyond its mere phonological characteristics . in the gb model of the eighties , morphological case was considered a spell-out of abstract case . while abstract case is present in all languages , the spell-out is only in a subset . in such a view , the presence of morphological case may help to uncover more abstract features , but in itself it does not have syntactic or semantic effects . this runs counter to observations that the presence / absence of morphological case correlates with the presence / absence of certain syntactic and semantic properties . a case in point is the more or less classical observation that the presence of morphological case is related to the possibility for several types of scrambling . other approaches have been proposed to incorporate ( some of ) these effects of morphological case and the idea that parametric differences should be reducable to morphological properties has been defended with varying success . against this background , the present workshop seeks answers for questions like the following : what is the relation between morphological case and abstract case ? what are the distributional , interpretive and phonological effects of the presence of morphological case ? the aim of this workshop is to bring together theoretical and empirical considerations on the effects of morphological case . issues for discussion involve the implications of morphological case for abstract case theory , the difference between structural and inherent case , agreement , word order phenomena , grammaticalization processes , discourse theory , and semantics . we welcome contributions relating to all aspects of linguistics . in particular we are interested in comparative , diachronic and acquisitional evidence that shows that relations between morphological case and other aspects of the grammar do ( not ) exist . the program will include three invited lectures of experts on the topic of morphological case . the provisional titles are as follows : paul kiparsky ( stanford ) : ` cases as complementizers ' joan maling ( brandeis ) : ` morphological case is not ( always ) to blame ! ' alec marantz ( mit ) : ` in defense of "" spell-out "" : why morphological case should indeed have only an indirect reflective relation to the syntax ' the workshop has room for 13 selected talks of 35 minutes . authors should submit 5 copies of an anonymous abstract of no more than 2 pages , one camera-ready copy indicating the author 's name and a 3x5 "" card with the author 's name , address , affiliation , e-mail address , phone number , and the title of the paper . we hope to be able to ( partially ) reimburse all speakers . please send your abstracts to : workshop on morphological case utrecht institute of linguistics ots trans 10 3512 jk utrecht the netherlands the deadline for submission is april 1 , 1998 . authors will be notified of acceptance by may 15 . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * olaf koeneman * * utrecht institute of linguistics ots * * trans 10 ( room 2 . 20 ) , 3512 jk utrecht * * tel . + 31 30 253 8304 * * email : koeneman @ let . ruu . nl * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

179,1056,"Subject: "" sycopahnt "" and "" sign of the fig ""
 
 the responses to my recent enquiry about the word "" sycophant "" and the "" sign of the fig "" were very interesting and varied . in view of this , instead of summarizing the responses i am forwarding them with minor editing : figs were first introduced in greece as expensive ( and therefore prestigious status symbols ) so that to own a fig tree was a big deal and waiting for the tree to come to fruit-bearing age and pick the fruit itself an even bigger deal . security was often low ( no electric street lights ) and so often non fig owners indulged in stealing figs ( it was probably a daredevil act too ) . so , it was decreed that anyone caught stealing figs was a crime and rewards were given to those who revealed ( phanein ) the fig ( syko ) thieves . of course , since the pilferers were probably less happy about being finked on than the fig owners , the term ' fig revealer / shower ' took on very negative connotation . it 's one thing to be steal badly and get caught ( 'd eservedly ' for botching up ) but quite another to be told on : and so goes on the lore about how sycophant came to be ( still used in modern greek , as it is in english ) but i cannot swear on its authenticity . at least that 's what we were taught in primary ( athens ) . jenny dalalakis , mcgill university , linguistics , e-mail bgbi @ musicb . mcgill . ca * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the sign of the fig is a highly insulting hand gesture used , so far as i know , in italy ( perhaps in other places , too . ) it is made by making a fist , with the thumb inserted between the index and middle fingers . the gesture represents th e female genitalia . a photograph of someone making the sign of the fig appears in the book gestures , a book of some ten to fifteen years ago illustrating and explaining various gestures , not just insulting ones , from a number of cul - tures . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * in dante 's inferno , the sign of the fig is a sign of disrespect , in this case aimed at god ( presumably because of the forbidden apple / fig thing . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * . . . by the sign of the fig you mean a gesture , quite common in many european cultures , where you put your thumb between the first 2 fingers . originally this was symbol for sexual intercourse and therefore an obscene sign . ( "" fig "" is one of the euphemisms for the female genital . ) i know from a viennese dialect dictionary that the sign used to be current hereabouts , but it is not widely used now , whereas in italy and esp . in russia ( as to greece , i forget ) it is very current now . in russian it has lost its original obscene meaning and means simply something like "" not at all "" or "" you are pretending to work while you are not "" or "" the hell you do "" . though not indecent . . still indecent . according to barbara monahan , ( a dictionary of russian gestures ) , "" this is one of the most widely used gestures in the soviet union . . . . it is not at all indecent or vulgar . it is really the nonverbal equivalent of a very strong "" no "" . ( p . 86 ) ( among adults it can be insulting . ) * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the etymology of sycophant is sukon ' fig ' and phainen ' to show ' . the story is that at one time it was supposedly against the law to export figs from athens and sukophantes often turned in violators of the unpopular law for their own personal gain , these toadies being widely despised . in a word , sycophants were originally informers on fig exporters . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the sign of the fig , also known by its latin name , "" manus ficus "" , was and apparently still is a mediterranean equivalent of the north american "" giving the finger "" insult . it is formed by placing the thumb between the index and middle fingers of the closed , fist . interestingly , in the american manual alphabet , it is the handshape representing the letter "" t "" , but is avoided in the manual alphabets of many countries and replaced by other similar but less offensive handshapes . according to _ the hand book _ ( linda lee and james charlton , prentice - hall , 1980 ) , "" the / fica / or fig sign is an ancient copulatory gesture . here the thumb is thrust between the forefinger and the middle finger of the same hand , simulating the penis thrust through a woman 's labia . ( . . . ) it is called the / fica / or fig because the inserted thumb is about the size and shape of the fig , which , being an ancient symbol of abundance , carried with it a sense of virility and fecundity to the / mano in fica / . ( . . . ) "" ( page 70 ) . i do n't know anything about the semantic evolution of the word , but informally , i can see how the present meaning of sycophant would apply to the kind of person who would hang around on the sidelines of the action at a trial , making rude gestures at an accused , deriving the right to do so by associating him / herself with the people in power who were judging the case . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * i seem to vaguely remember from my high school days that a sycophant was someone who kept an eye on the fig trees to make sure that no one stole the fruit . now , when someone was taken to court , because allegedly they had stolen figs , the sycophant would provide evidence against them by pushing aside the fig leaves and showing that some figs had been removed ! unfortunately , i cannot remember why it was a crime to cut the fruit of the fig trees ! were they intended to be offered to gods ? that could be a possible reason why they were so precious . i cann ' t remember really . . . incidentally , sycophantis in modern greek means the ' one who presents in court or in public unfounded accusations against someone ' . this probably relates to the fear of ancient athenians that someone might ' throw ' at them accusations that they would n't have been able to cope with , since a sycophant 's testimony was not to be questioned in any way . phantis in greek is an agent ; it does not mean the sign , but the person who presents something or makes something known . for example , ierophantis means someone who unravels the sacred signs of gods , i . e . a seer or prophet . modern greek has got both a verb sycopha ' nto and an abstract noun sycopha ' ntia . one last bit of ethnographic detail : it is or at least used to be common practice in greece to cut figs from trees without considering issues of who the tree / farm belongs to ! it is believed that fig trees just grow on their own without any special care and therefore do not belong to anybody . thanks for the opportunity to switch back to my mother tongue for a while ! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * sykophantes ist ein verbales rektionskompositum aus "" phaino : to sukon "" ( to point at the figs ) , das zum erstenmal bei aristophanes acharner 559 ( 425 v . chr . ) auftritt . sein urspruenglicher sinn ist schon in der antike umstritten , vgl . lidell - scott , s . v . : sykophantes ist ein verbales rektionskompositum aus "" phaino : to su : kon "" ( to point at the figs ) , das zum erstenmal bei aristophanes , ach . 559 ( 425 v . chr . ) auftritt . sein urspruenglicher sinn ist schon in der antike umstritten , vgl . lidell - scott , s . v . : "" orig . used of denouncers of the attempted export of figs from athens acc . to . . . plu . solon 24 , 2 . 523b ; . . . of citizens entrusted with the collection of figs as a part of public revenues etc . . . . these and modern explanations are mere guesses .

 hi . my name is dennis . i am a third-generation , professional hypnotherapist with over 22 years experience . i also , like many of you , spend a bit of time online . like you , i get hit by all sorts of mail either promoting sex sites or promising untold riches . being practical , i know multilevel marketing makes a lot of money for some people . . . the ones at the front end , at the beginning . but all the ones i have seen advertised are either the same one or clones of each other . i am sure you know the one i am talking about . i know people are still making money with it , or there would n't be so many advertisements . but they are n't making much , for two main reasons i can see . first it is the same , tired program that was old when i first went online a couple of years ago . anyone starting now would be at the tail end rather than the head . second perhaps more importantly . . . that program doesn ' t sell anything that people really want ! they wrote up some reports full of information that you probably either already know or do n't care about , just so they would have a product to sell . i have a solution . offer a product that people want to buy ! i have written clear , easy-to - read reports on self-hypnosis . most people have things they want to improve about their lives . many of these things , including stress , weight control , and smoking , can be taken care of with hypnosis . but people have good reasons why they do n't go to a hypnotherapist to take care of them . one is cost . even though being healthy saves money in the long run , people look at the short term expense and decide against it . another is pride . who wants to admit that they needed help from someone else ? it is almost like going to a psychiatrist . even though it is nothing to be ashamed of , it is still something few people want to admit . now people can learn how to take care of many of their problems themselves ! not only will they save money , they will have a sense of pride in being able to do it themselves . i am sure you have heard someone say before , "" i lost 15 pounds "" or "" i quit smoking . "" they are proud of what they have accomplished . i keep saying "" they "" because even though you will be able to use this knowledge for yourself , you will make your money by selling the reports to the many people that are also interested in hypnosis . with that other program i mentioned people have made a lot of money selling something nobody really wants . think how well you could do selling a product that is actually worth it ! i am trying to keep this email short , but want you to think about something else . i have seen multilevel emails that had the following : 1st level - 10 members with $ 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 2nd level - 10 from each of those 10 ( $ 5x100 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 500 3rd level - 10 from each of those 100 ( $ 5x1 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ $ 5 , 000 4th level - 10 from each of those 1 , 000 ( $ 5x10 , 000 ) _ _ _ _ _ $ 50 , 000 total $ 55 , 550 if they expect that much participation in a program that old , could n't you expect twice the participation per level ? getting 20 people instead of 10 for each level would make you $ 842 , 100 ! the first three reports teach how you can hypnotize yourself to improve you life . the fourth shows how to set up your email , how to get it out to others , and other tips and strategies you can use to be a success . i want you to be a success , because each person who replies to you , asking for report 1 , will also be replying to me asking for report 2 . then , when those people contact customers , you will be receiving money and orders from people you did n't even have to contact ! they will be advertising for you ! i am now going to list the reports and the addresses to order them from . just think , your name is going to be at the # 1 position , the one that makes the most money , when you send out your emails . report 1 : general information on self - hypnosis & relaxation and stress relief the perfect combination po box 798 chepachet , ri 02814 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 2 : weight loss rvp po box 190 wahiawa , hi 96786 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 3 : quitting smoking & other uses and tips for self - hypnosis s . franco po box 623 bonsall , ca 92003-0623 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - report 4 : turning it into a business j . destefano box 20793 1303 e . university blvd . tucson , az 85719-0521 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ordering instructions : * order each report from the person whose address is under the report title . you will need all 4 reports , because you will receive orders ( and money ) for each one , as your name travels down each of the 4 levels . * each report costs $ 5 . 00 cash . imagine receiving 100s of $ 5 . 00 checks a day , wondering which ones have cleared , and which ones have n't . you can see why cash is a necessity . the money should be wrapped in 2 pieces of paper , concealing it to prevent theft . * on one sheet of paper you should include the name & number of the report you are ordering , your email address , and your postal address . please write clearly . if your email address have parts that can be confused , i . e . 0 vs . o , l vs . i , etc . , please specify which it is . * the report will be sent to you as quickly as possible after your order is received . it will be sent as an attached document via email , unless there is trouble with your email address . the postal address will then be used as a backup . * make sure you save each report as you receive it , so you will be ready to send it out as you start receiving your orders ! * as i mentioned earlier , instructions on how to set up the email for you to mail out are on report 4 . for now , it would be best if you saved this email , so you will have it to work with later . finally , i want to remind you that this is a legitimate business . you should treat it as such when you enter it . you can talk to the small business administration if you need help in starting your business . you will of course need to pay local and federal taxes on the money you make . but since it is money you would n't have had otherwise , giving a little of it to uncle sam won't hurt . please contact the internal revenue service for any questions you have concerning applicable taxes . even though i am confident that a little effort will make you a success in this business , i can make no guarantees and none should be implied . actual profits made may be lower , equal to , or exceed the amounts mentioned in this letter . i would wish you luck , but i do n't feel luck is as important as making good decisions and having determination .

 i would like to second mark durie 's concerns with what he calls a "" pre-generative black hole in modern citation patterns "" . it seems a real problem to me that so many of the younger scholars trained in the chomskian school of linguistics are almost completely ignorant of any work done outside that school . on the other hand it seems those who do have a solid knowledge of the history of ideas in linguistics and have an awareness of typological diversity and have worked seriously with a number of languages tend to produce superior work . a prime example is the work of michael silverstein , whose work is grounded on a very thorough knowledge of the work of sapir , boas , saussure , bloomfield , etc . , as well as experience doing detailed work with american indian and australian languages , as well as a good knowledge of work done in the philosophy of language .

( 2 ) review ( 2a ) # 1 - tufftest - lite - free pc diagnostics utility&nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; &nbsp ; [ download @ www . ipcug . org ] &nbsp ; you arrive home with your new computer . sure , it hurt paying $ 1 , 800 , but you have it all - - large cardboard boxes , yards of cables , oceans of foam packing . assembly is a snap . as they told you in the store , every cable only fits one way . you follow all the instructions , turn it on and everything is perfect - you are very proud of yourself . &nbsp ; months later you start to experience mysterious problems and occasional system lock ups . probably some software tsr or driver has conflicted with windows again . as before , you spend endless hours trying to track it down , but this time to no avail . then one day , unfortunately just after the warranty runs out , it stops working . when you boot , you see a cryptic error message that says something about memory , or parity , or some such thing . &nbsp ; maybe you ' ll spend a lot of time swapping parts and playing with your computer 's insides - but if you do n't have the time or the skills , you ' ll lug the beast down to the repair shop and wait hours for their low-cost "" instant "" diagnostic service . then you ' ll pay "" more "" to get it fixed . it 's moments like these that you need # 1 - tufftest - lite . &nbsp ; # 1 - tufftest - lite by # 1-pc diagnostics company simply makes sure that your equipment is connected and working . before you set off on a software wild goose chase , # 1 - tufftest - lite blows the whistle on faulty hardware , in this case a bad memory simm in main memory . &nbsp ; sophisticated operating systems blur the line between hardware and software . when a program wants to access a drive , memory or port , windows manages the request . many test programs tell you that they are testing the hardware , but they can't really tell if the problem lies with the hardware , the software that controls it or windows . # 1 - tufftest - lite eliminates the problem by eliminating the complex operating system . &nbsp ; the program fits on a floppy disk and contains its own super slim operating system and device drivers . when it runs tests , nothing stands between them and the pc hardware . # 1 - tufftest - lite can directly attack drives , controllers , ports and memory , giving them a stiff workout and telling you whether they pass muster . &nbsp ; interestingly , this handy little utility reports fewer hardware faults than conventional diagnostic programs - - because it virtually eliminates the false positives that can be generated when software gets in the way . when it does report a problem with your equipment , you can be confident that it is worthwhile dismantling the system and making the trip back to the shop . when # 1 - tufftest - lite gives the all clear , it is sensible to assume that the issue is a software or setup one . &nbsp ; for the technically minded , # 1 - tufftest - lite runs a range of standard hardware checks . it starts with the motherboard and looks at the processor , math coprocessor , dma controller and real time clock . from there , it moves through a series of video and alignment and color tests , and onto the video adapter itself . after that , parallel and serial ports , floppy and hard drives and main memory are run through their paces . &nbsp ; one advantage of its small size is that # 1 - tufftest - lite automatically relocates from lower main memory to upper main memory and then back again on every pass . thus all of main memory is tested . no other diagnostics can do this because they have to occupy a large chunk of it themselves . after finishing with a check of extended memory , # 1 - tufftest - lite reports on your pc and its components . it produces a results display with a simple pass or fail for each component . if everything checks out , you have the satisfaction of knowing that your pc 's internals are a-ok . &nbsp ; the product does n't assume that you are technically minded . to run it , you turn off your pc , place the # 1 - tufftest - lite diskette in the floppy drive a and turn your pc on . the proprietary boot loader and operating system boots your pc and then automatically runs all the tests , with no user intervention if you like . the tests do n't alter any system settings , so even a novice can use it without fear of doing damage . return after 5-10 minutes and the report will be ready . &nbsp ; there is more to pc problem solving than a basic hardware check , but if you can't do that , you can spend a lot of time looking under the wrong rocks . &nbsp ; best of all , # 1 - tufftest - lite is freeware with no restrictions on its use or distribution so you really can't go wrong giving it a try .

( normally this kind of software is several hundred dollars ) they even give you easy to understand , proven , step by step instructions for success with this program . in fact , they helped me get started and i ' m so thankful . it 's hard to believe that this as simple as it is , but it really is simple . you will even get support from them via email anytime you need it . you won't get this kind of help from other programs of this nature . it makes all the difference in the world . my name is anne bowman . i am 31 - year-old graduate student desperately trying to finish my degree and begin working in my chosen field that is , if i am lucky enough to find a job in the crowded market . like most people in this day and age , it is hard to make ends meet , and being a student does not help the situation at all ( if i ever have to buy one more box of macaroni and cheese i think i would have to scream ) . i returned to school after having worked for several years with little potential for achieving what i had expected out of life . i figured if i returned to school and received my ph . d there would be several opportunities for me out there to achieve my goals . after seeing my fellow graduate students receive their degrees and , depressingly , not find respectable positions in their chosen field i began to think , "" oh no not again ! "" four extra years in school and an extra $ 20 , 000 in student loans on top of the first $ 18 , 000 , what will i do if the same happens to me ? "" i began to doubt my patience for the long term investment in schooling , and decided enough was enough , "" why can't i make real money now instead of waiting to graduate with no guarantee of a lucrative return for all of my efforts ! "" i am writing to share my experience with other hopeful students out there , as well as anyone looking for an opportunity to take their financial situation into their own hands . i hope you will consider this opportunity seriously and that this will change your life forever ! . , financially ! ! ! and once you get started it takes so little of your time . in mid october 97 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . i took this as a sign ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , it made perfect sense . here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start ( about as much as it costs for a pizza ! ) , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" i have nothing to lose "" . initially i sent 15 , 000 emails , ( without any costs to me ) only a couple of hours of my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the time to fulfil my orders . there is a vast on-line market available to everyone who owns a computer . following the advice of the person from whom i received this letter , i am telling you like it is , and i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! after you receive the reports they should explain everything to you . you may have some general questions , however , and after i send you report # 1 , please feel free to contact me and i will give you any advice you need . in one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by mid november , i had received 40 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program you will see that "" you must receive 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks if you don ' t send out more programs until you do !

 john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to the following new titles in the history of linguistics : the emergence of semantics in four linguistic traditions hebrew , sanskrit , greek , arabic wout van bekkum , jan houben , ineke sluiter , kees versteegh 1997 ix , 322 pp . studies in the history of the language sciences , 82 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 617 2 price : us $ 99 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 4568 1 price : hfl . 198 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com the aim of this study is a comparative analysis of the role of semantics in the linguistic theory of four grammatical traditions , sanskrit , hebrew , greek , arabic . if one compares the organization of linguistic theory in various grammatical traditions , it soon turns out that there are marked differences in the way they define the place of 's emantics ' within the theory . in some traditions , semantics is formally excluded from linguistic theory , and linguists do not express any opinion as to the relationship between syntactic and semantic analysis . in other traditions , the whole basis of linguistic theory is semantically orientated , and syntactic features are always analysed as correlates of a semantic structure . however , even in those traditions , in which semantics falls explicitly or implicitly outside the scope of linguistics , there may be factors forcing linguists to occupy themselves with the semantic dimension of language . one important factor seems to be the presence of a corpus of revealed / sacred texts : the necessity to formulate hermeneutic rules for the interpretation of this corpus brings semantics in through the back door . the noblest animate motion speech , pysiology and medicine in pre-cartesian linguistic thought jeffrey wollock 1997 xlvi , 470 pp . studies in the history of the language sciences , 83 us / canada : cloth : 1 55619 620 2 price : us $ 160 . 00 rest of the world : cloth : 90 272 4571 1 price : hfl . 320 , - - john benjamins publishing web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com for further information via e-mail : service @ benjamins . com the body of theory on speech production and speech disorder developed prior to descartes has been so neglected by historians that its very existence is practically unknown today . yet it provides a framework for understanding the speech process which is not only comprehensive and coherent , but of great relevance to current debates on issues of language performance and applied linguistics . this is because , the author contends , current theoretical difficulties stem largely from initial errors of descartes ; whereas earlier theoretical formulations , while outlining a bio-mechanics of speech , retain the central role of the human agent . the discussions explicated in this book come mainly from the natural - philosophic and medical literature of greco - roman antiquity , the middle ages , and the renaissance and early 17th century . this uncharted territory is mapped for the first time by tracing its textual history and diffusion as well as explaining the theory on its own terms but in language that will be clear and comprehensible to non-specialists . interdisciplinary in perspective , the book encompasses topics of interest not only to the language sciences , but also to the biosciences , medicine , philosophy of human movement , psychology and behavioral sciences , neurosciences , speech pathology , experimental phonetics , speech and rhetoric , and the history of science in general . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - bernadette martinez - keck tel : ( 215 ) 836-1200 publicity / marketing fax : ( 215 ) 836-1204 john benjamins north america e-mail : bernie @ benjamins . com po box 27519 philadelphia pa 19118-0519 check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com

 sally 's posting in response to the open letter indicates that * language * has decided to have illich - svitych 's book reviewed . that is good news - - unless this refers merely to the fact that late in 1990 or early in 1991 she asked eric hamp to do a review , which to my knowlege he declined to do . if indeed eric hamp is now going to review the book , i will be delighted . but it is not the case ( as some have charged ) that the open letter was written in spite of the fact that the signers knew , or could have found out , that a review was in the works . we were informed that hamp had declined . as recently as march 7 , 1994 , the language advisory committee seemed to have no knowledge of such a review . in response to an appeal from me , the committee urged that * language * do something on this issue , but in july * language * informed me that it would not . this , together with the fact that the incoming editor of * language * told me that he would have to stand by his predecessor 's decision ( something i can quite sympathize with ) is what prompted not just me but a number of distinguished members of the linguistic society to resort to the idea of an open letter . far from wishing to be divisive , i ( and others ) have tried since 1990 to address what we perceived to be a major omission , and to address it without public fanfare . however , this has had no effect . i report this with all due respect to the achievements of * language * under sally 's editorship , respect which i am sure is widely shared . it seems to me that a request that she change an editorial decision can in no way harm that distinguished record . alexis manaster ramer p . s . since the original posting , the following people have asked to have their names added to the signatories of the letter : edith moravcsik sebastian shaumyan david stampe daniel radzinski lloyd b . anderson - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - moderators ' message : we are taking the unaccustomed step of commenting on a discussion , because it 's christmas and we would love to encourage peace on ( the linguistic ) earth if we could . with regard to a review of illich - svitych 's work , all parties agree that : a ) * language * commissioned a review in 1991 b ) the original review is now unlikely to come in to us , these facts suggest both that ( a ) * language * acted fairly in soliciting discussion of nostratic and ( b ) the signers of the open letter acted in good faith in requesting another review . the linguistic issue here is the merit ( or non-merit ) of the book . if subscribers would like to address this issue after the break , we ' ll be happy to post such messages . otherwise , this discussion is closed . peace ! helen & anthony postscript : since it 's difficult to discuss a book no one has read , we would like to remind you that the book was announced on linguist as "" available for discussion .

 acl / coling-98 workshop on translingual information management current levels and future abilities august 16 , 1998 ( following acl / coling-98 ) university of montreal , montreal ( quebec , canada ) call for papers description - - - - - - - - - - the development of natural language applications which handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information is the next major challenge facing the field of computational linguistics . over the past 50 years , a variety of language-related capabilities has been developed in areas such as machine translation , information retrieval , and speech recognition , together with core capabilities such as information extraction , summarization , parsing , generation , multimedia planning and integration , statistics-based methods , ontologies , lexicon construction and lexical representations , and grammar . the next few years will require the extension of these technologies to encompass multi-lingual and multi-modal information . extending current technologies will require integration of the various capabilities into multi-functional natural language systems . however , there is today no clear vision of how these technologies could or should be assembled into a coherent framework . what would be involved in connecting a speech recognition system to an information retrieval engine , and then using machine translation and summarization software to process the retrieved text ? how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? this workshop is a follow-on to an nsf - sponsored workshop held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) , at which an international panel of invited experts will consider these questions in an attempt to identify the most effective future directions of computational linguistics research - - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information . the follow-on acl workshop is intended to open the discussion to the computational inguistics community as a whole . the workshop will include ample time for discussion . a report summarizing the discussions at granada will be available before the acl workshop . topics - - - - - the workshop will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation o automated ( cross-lingual ) summarization and information extraction o multimedia communication , in conjunction with text o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics - based ) of pre-parsing , parsing , generation , information acquisition , etc . we invite submissions which report on work in these areas . all papers should clearly identify how the work addresses the issues and questions outlined above . submissions - - - - - - - - - - only hard-copy submissions will be accepted . authors should submit six ( 6 ) copies of the full-length paper ( 3500-5000 words ) . submissions should be sent to : nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , new york 12604-0520 usa style files and templates for preparing submissions can be found at http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / styles . html the official language of the conference is english . important deadlines - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - submission deadline : march 23 , 1998 notification date : may 15 , 1998 camera ready copy due : june 15 , 1998 scientific committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - charles fillmore university of california berkeley , usa robert frederking carnegie mellon university , usa ulrich heid ( tentative ) university of stuttgart , germany eduard hovy information sciences institute , usa nancy ide vassar college , usa lauri karttunen ( tentative ) rank xerox research , france kimmo koskenniemi ( tentative ) university of helsinki , finland mun kew leong national university of singapore joseph mariani limsi / cnrs , france mark maybury the mitre corporation , usa sergei nirenburg ( tentative ) new mexico state university , usa akitoshi okumura ( tentative ) nec , japan martha palmer university of pennsylvania , usa james pustejovsky brandeis university , usa peter schaueble eth , switzerland oliviero stock irst , italy felisa verdejo uned , spain piek vossen university of amsterdam , netherlands wolfgang wahlster dfki , germany organizers - - - - - - - - - robert frederking , carnegie mellon university , usa eduard hovy , isi , university of southern california , usa nancy ide , vassar college , usa information - - - - - - - - - - information on the workshop can be found at http : / / www . cs . vassar . edu / ~ ide / translingual . html inquiries may be addressed to the organizers : robert frederking < ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu > eduard hovy < hovy @ isi . edu > nancy ide < ide @ cs . vassar . edu >

 minority languages in contex . diversity and standardisation call for papers ( deadline 16th febuary 1998 ) congress to be held in chur , switzerland - 21st - 23rd september 1998 organising committee : anna - alice dazzi - gross , mike makosch , lorenza mondada , jean - fran \ 231ois de pietro themes addressed by the congress the aim of the congress is to stimulate the study and discussion of contextual dimensions within which minority languages are spoken , shared and taught . the congress will provide a forum for the exchange and discussion of descriptive and comparative reports from a variety of regional and national settings including those in switzerland . the contexts within which minority languages evolve can be described from differing points of view along a continuum between two opposing poles . at one end of the continuum lay attempts to achieve stability and homogeneity which are usually articulated through projects aiming at the planning and normalisation of minority languages in order to present these codes as having equal status to adjacent majority languages . at the other end of the continuum we find destabilisation and heterogeneity observable at points of contact and overlap between minority and majority languages and often leading to hybrid forms which challenge traditional notions of linguistic code . these two poles involve a variety of actors and agents of differing social and institutional status , all exercising varying degrees of influence on the language situation in question . the congress will address three thematic areas highlighting the full range of this continuum . 1 : standardisation of minority languages 2 : minority and majority languages : coexistence , relationships and overlap . 3 : minority languages at school scientific and practical organization the thematic development of each day will take place in a series of parallel sessions run by those having responded to the call for papers and whose contribution has been accepted by the scientific committee . two types of session are foreseen : * papers : 20 minutes presentation followed by 20 minutes discussion * workshops : 90 minutes within which data and / or hypotheses can be presented , analysed and discussed in an interactive way responses to the call for papers should be sent to the scientific committee ( c / o l . mondada , romanisches seminar , university of basle , stapfelberg 7 / 9 , ch 4051 basle ) deadlines : response to call for papers : 16th febuary 1998 notification of acceptance by the scientific committee : 31st march 1998 definitive programme to be sent by : 30th june 1998 enrolment fees : speakers : sfr . 50 . - ( including dinner on tuesday evening and the published congress proceedings ) participants : paid by 30 . 4 . 1998 paid after 30 . 4 . 1998 students sfr . 50 . - - sfr . 70 . - vals members sfr . 80 . - - sfr . 110 . - non-members sfr . 100 . - - sfr . 130 . - ( including the published congress proceedings ) dinner on tuesday evening : sfr . 50 . - - _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ you can send an abstract or ask further informations to : lorenza mondada , romanisches seminar , university of basle , stapfelberg 7 / 9 , ch 4051 basle , fax 0041-61 - 261 . 61 . 41 , email : mondada @ ubaclu . unibas . ch _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

 greetings , this email is about fighting spam , and winning . > > please forward to your friends , family and co-workers to people that want to get spam out of their email : read this , you ' ll like what i am doing . . . . : ) to people that want to flame me for whatever reason : do n't be an egomaniac , i have a right to free speech , and the right to say it to a lot of people , so buzz off . - - - - - first let me tell you who i am and what i do . my name is robert young , i live in moscow , idaho , u . s . a . , and i have been using the internet since 1990 . i have watched the internet go from a small community of serious professionals to a roaring civilization of over 100 million people . until 8 months ago i had been a private investigator specializing in the apprehension of criminal fugitives . after 8 years of doing that i started getting burned out and decided to turn my life long hobby of programming computers into a full time job . now i write specialized applications for investigating and locating information on the internet . this summer , during the last week of july , i finally got fed up with the fact that i could not seem to get my 5 year old email address off of spam lists . i would reply to their emails with the word "" remove "" like most of them say and the next day i would get more . i sent my email address to remove lists , complained to administrators , postmasters , and my friends . none of it seemed to make a bit of difference . i decided to investigate the bulk email business . what i found made me so angry i almost blew a fuse . did you know : 1 . spammers steal valid email addresses and use them for return addresses . you could get the blame ! 2 . spammers purposely deceive filters designed to protect your email address . 3 . spammers "" hijack "" mail servers that are meant to relay messages from computer to computer . when they overload these servers , your legitimate email can be lost ! 4 . congress is not going to pass any laws in the united states anytime in the near future to stop this garbage , and they may never do so . some members of congress have actually campaigned through email . ( does that - really - surprise you ? ) 5 . when spammers register domain names with internic they never pay their bills because they know that the domain will be blocked and useless within 30 days , and interring gives them that long to pay before cutting them off . 6 . some spammers buy lists of accounts from hackers that have broken into internet service providers and use these accounts , that belong to other people , so they can connect to the internet without being concerned about losing the account . again , you get the blame , you lose your account . most of these spammers are genuine , authentic , certified jerks . i decided to get even , i took all of this very personally . within 3 weeks , the spam had dropped to a trickle . now i only get 2 or 3 a week instead of 7 or 8 each day . update : as of 02-oct - 1998 i have not gotten a single spam for 5 days . that 's a fact . i am starting to get comments from people that joined me two weeks ago that have noticed drops in their spam count of as much as 70 % . that is a fact as well . my list of active spammers is over 80 individuals now and it is growing every day . it does n't take government intervention , we all know that our government could n't feed a cat without spending $ 400 on a bag of cat food and starting 8 committees . what it does take is someone with the guts to take action , now ! what did i do ? first i recognized that spammers are not going to just quit , they make too much money doing it . the self righteous "" anti-spammers "" only wipeout mostly innocent business people with poor judgment . they have not put a single spam mailer out of business yet . not a one ! they just pop up with a different domain name , and dialup account the next day . the anti spammers have actually wiped out several potentially successful remove lists . you know why ? they do n't want it to end because then they would n't have a crusade anymore . think i ' m kidding ? i know who the anti-spammers are as well and believe me , their motivations are purely egotistical . in my opinion they have made spam worse by driving it underground and ruining the web based remove lists . try to go to www . remove-list . com , it is n't there anymore . so i am doing it different . human nature matters . . . i used my investigative experience to hunt down the - actual people - that were sending me spam . names , phone numbers , addresses , etc . it was n't easy but i had the background and knowledge to do it . i called each of these people and told them that if they did not immediately cease and desist sending mail to my address that i was going to give their name , address , phone number and anything else i had on them to every service provider in the country . that i would publish their information on the internet via the web , and that i would give their information to every ( legitimate ) anti - spam group i could find . i was polite and adult about the issue but i made it very clear that i was dead serious . nothing else has worked . people have been trying to get rid of spam for several years with no success . this method works ! ! ! if i told you i could do the same thing for you would you be interested ? i thought so . here is what you need to do : first : start your text editor ( notepad , vi , whatever ) second : type the following information and print it . first name last name primary email address ( remember your email may have two forms such as : joe @ isp . com and joe @ mail . isp . com . include both , contact your isp if you are n't sure ) family member ' s addresses ( one per line please ! ) third : mail this information to me : robert young attn : no more spam please ! ! ! c / o super fast services 116 e . 3rd . st . suite 206 moscow , id 83843 we need donations to support this fight . i started out doing this for friends and family , then their friends and family , and now it is starting to cost us a lot of money . please include a donation of five dollars either a five dollar bill , or a check made out to me . we are hoping that there are enough decent people out there that appreciate what we are doing and will pitch in a few bucks to help us pay for the phone calls , computer time , database searches , and hiring people to do the data entry for the 600 plus letters we are getting every day . p l e a s e h e l p ! i guarantee you will think it is the best five bucks you have ever spent if you are sick of spam . thanks for taking the time to reply to this letter , i hope to hear from you soon . working together we can defeat unwanted spam for good .

240,959,"Subject: re : 5 . 1500 comparative method , polarization & reviews
 
 i am forwarding the following for posting at the request of robert rankin ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . unkans . edu ) . i do not subscribe to this list and have no wish to join the fray at present , but when my name is mentioned sometimes the file is forwarded to me via e-mail . thus the following : andy anderson cites me on three points in a series of recent postings . i have known andy upwards of 30 years and do not feel that he would in - tentionally misrepresent my views , but i also feel a couple of things need clarification . first , i am uncomfortable about being formally cited as a ( secondary ) source of information on lyle campbell 's paper from the boulder ( green - berg ) conference of ca . 1990 . if andy wishes to distribute an attack on the paper or its author in written form , he should first obtain an actual copy of it or , alternatively , await its publication . i guess i should n't have brought it up in our conversation at the ssila / aaa meetings . second , i am said to have reported that the geneticists who have studied the mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) of sundry native american and siberian peo - ples claim that there were / are "" two subgroups within amerind ( aside from the eskimo and athabaskans ) . "" this is not what i ( or the paper 's authors wallace , torroni and schurr , et al . ) said . the authors did not address themselves to the linguistic problems and most certainly did n't talk about "" subgroups "" . nor did i , since i do not regard the historicity of anything like "" amerind "" as even remotely established . the authors of the paper did posit at least four "" migrations "" . they do not discuss the most recent , eskomo - aleut , in their abstract , but i think they gave a time depth figure of about 6000 years bp ( before present ) for it orally - - do n't quote me . from their abstract : for what they call na - dene their figure is 7000-10000 years bp . then they say they have evidence for at least two "" migrations "" preceding that . one comes between 12000-15000 bp and the earliest between 26000-34000 bp . figures as high as 40000 bp were mentioned orally , as i recall . they did not attempt to correlate their figures with our knowledge of periods of glaciation or the periodic existence of the land bridge in beringia . i leave it to readers to decide what this portends for the amerind hypo - thesis or its proposed ( glotto ) chronology , but a warning is in order in any event . note that i have written "" migration "" in quotes above . this is not because i wish to pejorate the term ; it is because geneticists use it in a very special way . for them it has to do solely with the ap - pearance of specific genetic material in american populations . they then assume a common ancestor and calculate the number of millennia by positing a uniform mutation rate for mtdna . the material and theories they work with force this definition of migration on them . all this says nothing about the situation "" on the ground . "" in reality though , each of these genetic migrations can have included many distinct movements of people across beringia over a great many years - - perhaps centuries or even millennia . and they may have represented many ling - guistic groups . all that is required in order for entire clusters of migrations "" on the ground "" to get read as a single mtdna "" migration "" is a relatively homogeneous gene pool in eastern siberia over the particular time span when the "" genetic mutation "" occurred . the evidence does indeed suggest four genetic migrations , but it really says little or nothing about how many "" real "" migrations there were with - in each of the four clusters , nor does it say anything about linguistic diversity - - much less "" subgroups of amerind . "" we may wish it did , but it does n't . i do note with interest however the rough correlation between the geneticists ' oldest figures and the calculations of nichols ( 1990 in language 66 . 3 ) based on linguistic diversity in the western hemisphere . the more recent sets of mtdna dates fall within the esta - blished archaeological ballpark for clovis believers , although the earliest set certainly does not . one very short contribution of my own here - - mostly my wife 's actually , since she is a molecular geneticist and we talk about these things over breakfast . the yardstick used by mtdna geneticists in these cal - culations may not be appreciably better than that used in glottochrono - logy , i . e . , genetic mutation takes place at a rate which is only rela - tively constant . it can be speeded up by various singular events from cosmic ray bombardment to ingesting certain fungi infecting the grain from your cache pit . biologists try to allow for this sort of thing , but as you can see from the plus / minus dates for each cluster , we are not talking about something as precise as dendrochronology or even radiocarbon dating . the mtdna studies are very interesting but we must bear in mind their limitations and special use of the term "" migration "" . lastly , in an earlier posting andy mentions that i had examined green - berg 's notebooks and determined how he had mislabeled so much of his siouan data in lia . andy 's description of the way the notebooks are laid out is correct , but i have only actually seen xeroxes of the pages of siouan entries , not the notebooks themselves . i might add that the siouan entries in the notebook are hard by the iroquoian , caddoan , yuchi entries demonstrating once again that greenberg had decided on the final classification of these families when he laid out his notebook design and before the vocabularies from the languages were entered . my thanks to john koontz for posting this . sincerely , bob rankin ( university of kansas ) ( rankin @ ukanvm . cc . ukans . edu )

 would you be able to defend yourself if attacked on the street ? ? ? hello - most people could n't answer that question with any confidence . with todays crime rate and drug abuse problem , it 's a question that everyone needs to ask themselves . crime statistics from the bureau of justice state that : - 25 % of violent crimes occur at or near the victim 's home - 14 % at school and 12 % at commercial establishments ( stores ) - a woman is raped every 2 minutes in america - 1 out of every 4 rapes takes place in a public area or a parking garage . - 23 % reported being involved with a leisure activity at the time they were victimized . - 21 % reported they were at work or traveling to or from work when the crime occurred . as you can see , a violent crime can happen to anyone at any time regardless of where you live or work . these crimes consisted of assault , robbery , carjacking , rape and murder . based on these statistics , it 's almost guaranteed that you will be the victim of a violent crime at some point in your life . will you react ? ? ? ? i ' ve been studying the martial arts for fifteen years and have been an instructor for thirteen of them . i ' ve been fortunate enough to have studied under some of the best instructors in the country . i currently have a black belt in kenpo karate and have studied tae kwan do , kung fu and i am currently studying hapkido and isfa shootfighting . my video , "" a chance to escape "" , will show you how to defend yourself against the seven most common types of attacks on the street . i will show you self defense techniques that anyone from ages eight to eighty can learn and use to defend themselves . these techniques are quick and easy to learn and can be the difference between life or death if you are attacked on the street . my video uses easy to understand terms for younger children . this video is a must for any college student ( male or female ) . the techniques in this video are not only good for self defense but for building confidence when out in public . senior citizens and middle age adults will gain the most benefit from this video . it will also give you helpful hints on how to carry packages and purses so they won't get taken , how to avoid looking like a victim , and how to use common objects as weapons to fend off even the most aggressive attacker . with so many self defense videos on the market , it is about time that there was one made for people who want one simple and effective so they can actually use the techniques within minutes of learning them . the best part is that you won't have to study karate for fifteen years in order to do these techniques . just a few short minutes and you will understand how effective you can be . when it comes right down to it , you are your own best judge as to whether you feel safe or not . my video will help you to feel that you have an edge on anyone who may try to attack you . it 's impossible to know when or where a violent crime will happen and the last thing you want to be is the victim . this video gives you the chance you need to react and avoid becoming a victim . all you really need is "" a chance to escape .

 call for papers the machine translation journal special issue on anaphora resolution in machine translation guest editor : ruslan mitkov ( university of wolverhampton ) the interpretation of anaphora is crucial for the successful operation of a machine translation system . in particular , it is essential to resolve the anaphoric relation when translating into languages which mark the gender of pronouns . unfortunately , the majority of mt systems developed in the seventies and eighties did not adequately address the problems of identifying the antecedents of anaphors in the source language and producing the anaphoric "" equivalents "" in the target language . as a consequence , only a limited number of mt systems have been successful in translating discourse , rather than isolated sentences . one reason for this situation is that in addition to anaphora resolution being itself a very complicated task , translation adds a further dimension to the problem in that the reference to a discourse entity encoded by a source language anaphor by the speaker ( or writer ) has not only to be identified by the hearer ( translator or translation system ) but also re-encoded in a coreferential expression in a different language . the nineties have seen an intensification of research efforts in anaphora resolution in machine translation . this can be seen in the growing number of related projects which have reported promising new results ( e . g . wada 1990 ; leass & schwall 1991 ; nakaiwa & ikehara 1992 ; chen 1992 ; saggion & carvalho 1994 ; preu _ et al . 1994 ; nakaiwa et al . 1994 ; nakaiwa et al . 1995 ; nakaiwa & ikehara 1995 ; mitkov et al . 1995 ; mitkov et al . 1997 ) . however , we still feel that additional work is needed to highlight and further explore the specifics of the problem in operational mt environments , including fully automatic machine translation and machine - aided translation . we are inviting high-quality , original research papers describing recent advances in anaphora resolution in machine translation . topics to be addressed include ( but are not limited to ) - operational anaphora resolution components in machine translation - resolution of zero pronouns in mt environments - lexical transfer of anaphors across languages - to what extent have the latest trends towards knowledge-poor , corpus - driven and robust approaches in anaphora resolution , been called upon in machine translation ? - what are the most scalable contributory factors / resolution strategies in mt ? - what makes anaphora resolution a more complex task in machine translation ? submission and format articles should be submitted directly to the publishers , either by e-mail to ellen . klink @ wkap . nl , with the subject header "" submission to coat anaphora special issue "" , or in hard-copy to machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 990 3300 az dordrecht the netherlands or machine translation editorial office kluwer academic publishers p . o . box 230 accord , ma 02018-023 u . s . a . the submission deadline is 15 may 1997 . the journal is typeset using latex , so the preferred medium for submission of articles in electronic format is latex source ( using the kluwer style file ) or gzipped postscript . for more details , please consult the journal 's web pages : home page : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / journalhome . htm / 0922-6567 instructions for authors : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / kaphtml . htm / ifa0922-6567 latex style files : http : / / kapis . www . wkap . nl / jrnlstyle . htm / 0922-6567 if submitting hard-copy , four copies of the paper are required . the length of the papers should be approximately 10-20 pages if using the kluwer style file ( around 20k words ) . authors are also requested to send a copy of an abstract of not more than 200 words to the guest editor r . mitkov @ wlv . ac . uk or in hard-copy to ruslan mitkov , school of languages and european studies , university of wolverhampton , stafford st . , wolverhampton wv1 1sb , united kingdom . guest editor : ruslan mitkov school of languages and european studies university of wolverhampton stafford st . wolverhampton wv1 1sb telephone ( 44-1902 ) 322471 fax ( 44-1902 ) 322739 email r . mitkov @ wlv . ac . uk guest editorial board : breck baldwin ( university of pennsylvania , philadelphia ) david carter ( sri international , cambridge ) guenter goerz ( university of nuernberg / erlangen ) lynette hirschman ( mitre , mclean ) richard kittredge ( university of montreal ) susan luperfoy ( mitre , mclean ) tony mcenery ( lancaster university ) ruslan mitkov ( university of wolverhampton ) frederique segond ( ranx xerox , grenoble ) harold somers ( umist , manchester ) keh - yih su ( national tsing hua university , taiwan ) yorick wilks ( university of sheffield )

 definitely , a play of musement : subject : the software schism ( fwd ) thanks to nancy owens ( nowens @ csun . edu ) and harold goldwhite ( harold _ goldwhite @ qmbridge . calstate . edu ) i append extracts from a piece by umberto eco that was first posted on the internet in oct . 94 : "" . . . i am firmly of the opinion that the macintosh is catholic and that dos is protestant . indeed the mac is counterreformist and has been influenced by the methodical path of the jesuits . it tells the faithful how they must proceed step by step to reach-if not the kingdom of heaven - the moment in which their document is printed . it is catechistic ; the essence of revelation is dealt with via simple formulae and sumptuous icons . . . . . dos is protestant and even calvinistic . it allows free interpretation of scripture , demands difficult personal decisions , imposes a subtle hermeneutics upon the user , and takes for granted the idea that not all can reach salvation . to make the system work you need to interpret it yourself ; the user is closed within the loneliness of his own inner torment . . . . . with the passage to windows the dos universe has come to resemble more closely the counterreformist tolerance of the mac . it 's true : windows represents an anglican - style schism - - big ceremonies in the cathedral but with the possibility of returning to dos to fiddle with things . with windows you can still decide to allow women and gays to be priests if you want to . and what about the machine language that lies beneath both operating systems ? ah , that is the stuff of the old testament , talmudic and kabbalistic .

 ( pardon this intrusion , you were mentioned as someone who would have an interest in technology ) we are in the beginning of an exciting , "" trillion dollar emerging market "" in technology . in the next 3 minutes below , i will show you how to capitalize on this extraordinary trend ! here 's the trillion dollar trend in american business that i ' m speaking of ! you may have noticed over the past few months the incredible number of billion dollar mergers in us business . huge mergers like worldcom and mci , travelers and citicorp - the list is endless but they one common thread - services , services , services ! ! services like : travel services , banking services , telephony services , entertainment services and utility services . all of these services that you , i and everyone we know use , are being combined into one , trillion dollar market of "" bundled services "" . services have been the fastest growing segment of the us economy for a number of years but this "" bundled services "" market is new . these are services that everyone uses - everyday , offered from one , simple source ! why are "" bundled services "" such a big deal ? let 's add it up : banking services = hundreds of billions travel services = hundred of billions telephony services = $ 200 billion in us , $ 1 trillion worldwide ( internet access , paging , cellular , long distance , local dial , cable tv , digital satellite , voice mail , virtual office , web tv ) utilities ( being deregulated now ) : electricity = $ 250 billion , gas = $ 70 bill . internet commerce = $ 8 billion ( projected to reach $ 350 billion in 5 years ) in short , "" bundled services "" are every conceivable service that you , i and everyone we know uses . a war is waging for these huge markets with the largest service companies in the world , and millions will be made from those entrepreneurs who position themselves in front of this trend . these service / technology companies are buying companies left and right so they can offer more services . these companies are fighting tooth and nail because they know something most of us do n't know . as a gte study reveals , when a customer enrolls on a single service they will stay on that service for an average of 2 years , with two services the average moves to 4 years . when a customer enrolls on 3 services , they will stay with that provider for an incredible average of 20 years ! imagine the cash flow on just one customer using 3 - 6-10 - 20 services , for 20 years . what would that cash flow be worth ? a whole bunch , and that 's why the race is on . the first company to get customers on 3 or more services - wins ! that 's why these service companies are spending billions in advertising to attract customers . but . . . these huge , traditional service companies have a serious problem . they can not get directly in front these customers . even if they could send someone directly over , would they find them at home ? if they were at home , would they let them in their house ? people decide on which service companies they wish to use , based on recommendations from people they know ! here 's my point : who better to make recommendations for services than from the people you know ! we do this unconsciously everyday anyway - now you can get paid for it ! we simply , and very passively , offer people we know , a "" free package of services "" designed to save them money and make their life simpler . the more they use the more they save ! this package will make their life easier with single billing for all the services they use . we can save them money by leveraging our parent companies $ 1 . 6 billion dollar buying power to offer the most competitive prices available anywhere for this package ! it gets even better ! we are not talking about no-name companies with questionable service . we are talking about the biggest service and technology companies in the world ! companies that are already a household name . these companies realize that "" word of mouth "" is the best way to get in front of customers . your associates & friends win , and you win ! they handle all the service / customer support - we just make the recommendation ( this could be as simple as passing out a brochure ) . services can create a true residual income ( no inventories here ! ) . what could an extra $ 10 - $ 50 , 000 a year do for your family - for the next 20 years ? with a more concentrated effort , the potential is "" income replacement "" and beyond . in addition to the monthly residual income you will earn on these services , you may also earn over rides on other re-marketers . the system of delivering services in the next evolutionary step in networking - we call it "" internetworking "" . the reason we call it "" internetworking "" is that everything can be accomplished via the internet . given the trillion dollar size of this untapped market , our financial backing and billion dollar partners , we project that we will be a billion dollar company and household name in 3 years . you are learning about us in the first 30 days ! timing is everything . imagine if you talked with an associate who has numerous property management contacts . let 's say this contact of yours knew several property managers who own thousands of rental units . the property management company could offer these services to thousands of tenants . the property management company earns a fortune , your associate earns a fortune and you earn a fortune . this is leveraged income ! there are hundreds of ways to market this because everyone uses these services . as a matter of fact , who do you know that would not be interested in saving money on their service bills , with the same top grade service companies and have the convenience of a single bill ? in summary , bundled services are a trillion dollar untapped market , ripe for entrepreneurs with vision . customers get the same quality service from the largest providers but now through one source ! because of our buying power and the fact you afford to give bigger discounts when customers are using more services ( bundled ) , it 's a win / win situation , and represents one of the largest business trends of this century . . . food for thought . . . social psychologists tell us that each person runs into at least two opportunities that could in fact , reshape their lives . the question here is this , is this your first opportunity or your last ? an interesting question . with a simple investigation , you will determine this opportunity and company , is for real . if you ' re too busy , that 's exactly why you need to do this . in three years or less , you can create the lifestyle you wish , with the effort of course . get the facts and make an informed decision . please visit our site now : http : / / www . vwcs . com / pauld thank you for your attention , the wave 4 group ps : this is a one time mailing

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered !

"" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . = 20 any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 20 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 20 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 20 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 20 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 20 , 000 programs each for a total of 2000 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 20 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to = will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for = a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do = that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is = practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , now very legal , money making opportunity . it does = not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and = best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a now perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = 20 to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 usd cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number ( international orders should also include $ 2 usd extra for postage ) = 20 add your e amil address when sending in for your report this is for = 20 updated information and continueing support ( optional ) that will = 20 be handed down by your sponcers pipeline . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 "" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales "" order report # 1 from : a . siegmund # 57 trakehnenstr . 13 53332 bornheim , germany _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 "" major corporations and multi-level sales "" order report # 2 from : j . maz 15774 s . lagrange rd suite # 312 orland pk , il 60462 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 "" sources for the best mailing lists "" order report # 3 from : b . thompson 13504 greencaslte ridge tr . 404 burtonsville md . 20866 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 "" evaluating multi-level sales plans "" order report # 4 from : muw # 2 po box 71442 salt lake city , ut 84171-0442 usa _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion one of your free web sites can be registered at = http : / / www . freeyellow . com / . i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20 to 90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . = 20 = = = = = = 09 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - headers - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - return - path : received : from relay01 . mail . aol . com ( relay01 . mail . aol . com = [ 170 . 31 . 108 . 127 ] ) by air21 . mail . aol . com ( v37 . 0 ) with smtp ; mon , 22 dec = 1997 12 : 34 : 39 - 0500 received : from bonaly . hw . ac . uk ( bonaly . hw . ac . uk [ 130 . 195 . 251 . 5 ] ) by relay01 . mail . aol . com ( 8 . 8 . / 8 . 8 . / aol - 4 . 5 . 0 ) with smtp id maa19336 ; mon , 22 dec 1997 12 : 29 : 50 - 0500 ( est ) date : mon , 22 dec 1997 12 : 29 : 50 - 0500 ( est ) from : ziaza99 @ sh . hit . no received : from 007 ( sdn-ts - 047mdrelrp11 . dialsprint . net ) by = bonaly . hw . ac . uk ( mx v4 . 2 axp ) with smtp ; mon , 22 dec 1997 17 : 29 : 48 + 0000 ( gmt ) to : ziaza99 @ sh . hit . no comments : authenticated sender is subject : freefree web site now message - id : = 09 = = 20 - - = 20

 dear subscribers , recently i came across an example of better used without had in the following construction : she better stop . as it was an american publication , i assumed that the use of had in such expressions had completely disappeared , in written as well as spoken us english . i would not have been surprised to find that it had disappeared from spoken usage , since there are obvious phonological reasons , but the loss of it in writing indicated to me that the use of better alone was quite standardised . this poses a question for me , and i was wondering if anyone out there has a suggestion . if it is now standardised , and there is no longer a had , why does n't the former bare infinitive stop now become finite and take 3ps inflection ( ? she better stops ) ? is this because it now has assumed a subjunctive-like quality ? can it then be associated with the expression : it is better that she stop ? if so , can another adjective be substituted for better here , e . g . it is good that she stop ) ? ? she good stop ? how has this been reanalysed , and what are the implications ? ( susan dopke informs me that some grammarians have interpreted better in these contexts as an auxiliary , and if that is the case , can we use sub-aux inversion to make it a question ? ( ? better she stop ? ) is this now acceptable too ? please send your suggestions if this bothers you . debbie ziegeler

 hello , this is a query about the different ways in which dates can be expressed in different languages , and whether there are constraints that apply in relation to register ( eg formal , informal , etc ) , genre ( magazine , newspaper , personal vs business letter , etc ) , historical , instrumental ( format of calendars ) , nationality , etc . my initial impressions are the following . as far the english speaking world goes , in britain there is a variety of ways in which dates can be expressed in writing , including day month year ; day-ordinal month year ; month day , year ; month day-ordinal , year . interestingly , this variety is not found in numerical form , in which ` day / month / year ' is expected . note that the separators vary , the most common being the slash ( / ) , others being the dash ( - ) , the period ( . ) and the blank space ( ) . in the other formats in which words are used , only the ` month ' slot can be spelled out , with days and years being expressed in numbers . variations include the use of ` the ' preceding ordinal day numbers . sometimes one can find different formats being used in different parts of the same publication , eg the header and the report in a newspaper . this seems to be in contrast with the usa where ` month day , year ' seems to predominate whatever the situation , even when expressed numerically as in 1 / 7 / 95 which is normally read by americans as the seventh day of the month of january , whereas the british would take it to mean the first day of the month of july , which is a 6 - month difference . apparently , the americans are the only ones to adopt month / day / year . someone once told me this is an old format which came into being as a result of the fact that , in looking for today 's date , one would look in a calendar first of all for the current month , with the year being taken for granted . any ideas ? what 's the norm in other languages / dialects , etc ? thanks in advance , tony - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - tony berber sardinha | tony1 @ liverpool . ac . uk aelsu | fax 44-51 - 794-2739 university of liverpool | po box 147 | http : / / www . liv . ac . uk / liverpool l69 3bx | ~ tony1 / homepage . html uk | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

( if you > do n't i ' ll say "" i thought not ! "" ) i suppose i ' m taking up benji 's gage , though i want it understood that i ' m very much in sympathy with what he has to say . i remember a little over 10 years ago i was taking a course in lexical phonology , and got into an argument with the prof . because he insisted that one of the co - rollaries of the theory was that ' people ' is inherently plural , which explained the non-existence of the overt plural ' peoples ' . i insisted that the word ' peoples ' certainly does exist and that therefore any theo - retical claim that it does n't was ipso facto falsified . ( cf . rev . vii 9 : ' a great multitude which no one could number , from every nation , from all tribes and * peoples * and languages ' . now , presumably ' people ' in this passage means something like ' ethnic group ' , and is not therefore precisely equivalent to ' people ' meaning ' many persons ' , or ' the set of all human beings ' . i would also note that one common meaning of ' universe ' is ' the set of all existing things ' , which would also imply that the word ' universes ' ought not to exist either , but it does . for one thing , there is a variant usage of ' universe ' which makes it roughly synonymous with ' galaxy ' or ' group of galaxies ' , of which of course there are many . it is also freely used in talking about ' parallel universes ' , etc . ) > from a paedagogical point of view i think it is perfectly legitimate for a linguistics teacher to say , ' here 's a bunch of strings , with attendant grammaticality judgments . what generalizations can we draw from these data ? ' we can save ourselves from the threat of the protest of a student who happens to be fluent in the language under discussion against a gram - maticality judgment by invoking the notion of ' idiolect ' and claiming ' these judgments are an accurate reflection of one particular individu - al 's own linguistic behaviour . what can we deduce about the internalized grammar of that individual ? ' this , of course , assumes that what we as linguists are concerned about is language as a psychological / cognitive phenomenon , and i believe that that is legitimate . but we are also , in my opinion legitimately , concerned about language as a social phenomenon . in which case language is not ( simply ) the property of an individual mind but of a community , and ' gram - maticality judgments ' may be different at the communal level from the individual level . i think as teachers we need to be honest with our stu - dents about this , which means allowing ourselves the luxury of a certain type or level of judgment on one occasion and a different one on another , but as much as possible each time making it clear to our students what level we ' re working at . addressing the broader issues that have come up following joseph stemberger 's posting in linguist 5-1163 , i think we also need to make clear the difference between ' grammaticality ' and ' acceptability ' judg - ments . i have an introductory lecture , prepared for a course i have as yet had no opportunity to teach , in which i attempt to explain that a given string ( e . g . , ' 3 is angry ' or ' my toothbrush is pregnant ' ) may be perfectly grammatical but semantically or pragmatically anomalous , and might be rejected for that reason , while another string ( e . g . , ' tooth - brush my am orange ' or ' there are a rabbit in garden ' ) may be fully in - terpretable and therefore not semantically anomalous but nevertheless violate certain constraints of grammar . i would be inclined to reject any claim that , as georgia green occasionally put it ( facetiously ) in class and elsewhere , ' the rules of grammar must include the rules of arithmetic and all other real-world knowledge ' . thus , if my son were to say , ' the moon is made of green cheese ' i might challenge him on the * content * of his statement , but not on its * con - struction * . dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *

 while proofreading a translation of a text into english i found a reference to chess as "" the game of kings "" . this expression is a literal translation of an equivalent hebrew expression . the english sources i know use the term "" the royal game "" ( which may well be the source for the hebrew expression , king and royal being derived from the same root ) . in english "" game of kings "" sounds a bit off to me . i would be grateful if anyone could tell me whether one of those expressions is preferable to the other . thanks uri bruck bruck @ actcom . co . il

simply fax your check to : 808-878 - 6869 so do n't hesitate , call today this offer is for a limited time only ! what is express mail server ? express mail server ( ems ) bulk e-mail software is the only thing that works . ems transforms your computer into a personal mail server . with no additional hardware , ems software will give you complete control of your mailings , because the mail you send will originate from your computer and be delivered directly into the mailbox of your recipient . since the mail originates from your computer , it is no longer necessary to use your internet service provider 's mail server . when you use the previous generation stealth or cloaking type programs , they work by uploading your mail to your provider 's mail server . they can also be programmed to send mail through other providers mail servers without authorization ( this is considered theft of service ) . the problem is , the previous generation stealth type programs upload the messages faster than these mail servers can process them . many times this causes a provider 's mail server to bog down and crash . obviously , this will make providers furious with you . furthermore , you may think that you are sending hundreds of thousands of messages , unfortunately , most of it simply gets filtered and deleted by the mail server . you are lucky to get 10 % - 20 % of that mail delivered . with ems software your computer emulates a mail server and you actually control and watch all your mail being delivered piece by piece . there is a 100 % delivery rate with this program anywhere on the internet . we did say 100 % delivery rate to any internet email addresses . a bold claim but it is true . this is the latest technical advance in bulk email since the advent of the stealth type programs . this program verifies domains and validity of email addresses before sending mail . this dramatically reduces your bounced back undeliverables . bounced back undeliverables can sure bog down a server . you can also control where you want any bounced back mail to go . it can go to any email address you want with ems . ems can work with any dial up internet account , ( aol is not considered a dial up internet account ) an isdn line or a t - 1 or t - 3 . it runs on windows 95 or nt . we have not heard of any person losing a dial up account with this software . one reason bulk email is so frowned upon with numerous isp 's ( internet service providers ) is people try to send as much mail as they can , as quick as they can and crash the mail server of the isp . this won't happen with ems software since you do n't since you do n't use the mail server of the isp to send your mail . the program actually sends the mail directly from your computer , which is now , a bona fide mail server , to the recipients mail server avoiding any potential blocks that would prevent you from reaching those on your mailing list . you do not have to "" forge "" headers or randomize anything to have 100 % of your mail delivered , although the program does allow for randomization and customizing of headers . you can send mail omitting the "" to "" "" from "" and "" reply to "" portions of your headers . want to send out your messages in color . this is not a problem with ems . just select a font color with your mouse , and then click on a background color as well . want to make your font bold or put it into italics , just point and click . want your message centered or shifted left or right , once again just point and click . unlike all of the others , ( which are all the same , but go by different names ) this software is very straightforward and easy to use . if you can log on to aol , you already know more about computers than you 'd need to use ems . we also provide technical support by phone to answer any questions you may have . ems works with any windows 95 or nt computer . it requires no additional hardware or software . the ems software sends at speeds up to 80 , 000 messages per hour delivered using a modest pentium and a 28 . 8 modem . rates will dramatically increase with an isdn or cable modem and of course with a t - 1 they will be even faster . if you want to take advantage of this breakthrough in bulk email technology give us a call on the number below . we do n't plan on repeat mailings for this product so take advantage of this opportunity . the cost to you is $ 275 . 00 ! money well spent if you consider that you can buy stealth ( or the many others like it . . . they all operate the same way ) for $ 400 . you might be happy with stealth if you do n't mind frequent loss of dial-up accounts , and lot of complaints . not getting a lot of your mail delivered due to blocks and crashed mail servers deleting your mail , along with the resulting low response rate from your mailings , all of which defeated the purpose of e-mailing in the first place ! few people are aware of this new technology , so you are already leaps and bounds ahead of any competition . using this , you can sell anything you wish , over and over . also , consider that you may decide to offer a mailing service to others . you ' ve probably gotten e-mails that claim they can send your advertisement e-mail for a cost of $ 200 per 100 , 000 . what most people do n't realize is that only 20 or 30 of the mail they pay these people to get sent actually gets delivered ! this mailing service is very profitable , and using this software , you can advertise that service to millions for free ! we also have cd roms with 60 million addresses to help you start . with your purchase , visit our web site at : http : / / 138 . 27 . 44 . 5 . cearth . on . ca / users / imc ( if you can't log into the site just call us , sometime the site is overloaded with hits ) call i . m . c at : phone : ( 808 ) 876-1550 fax : ( 808 ) 878-6869 and place your order today while supplies last and we ' ll be happy to send you a demo copy and answer any questions you may have . or call us and we will give you our full service web site addresses to be removed from our mailing list or to be added to our "" global remove list "" simply go to : http : / / www . ctct . com all remove requests are respectfully immediately

328,1520,"Subject: summary : borrowing of body part terms
 
 many moons ago i posted a query regarding the borrowing of certain body part terms , notably , heart , eye , ear , and tongue , and never posted a summary ( tsk , tsk ) . here it is : first of all , i have been able to find , either through linguist or from other sources , clear examples of almost all the basic body part terms , including ' hand ' ( many iranian languages from persian , ossetic from chechen - ingush ) , ' heart ' ( polish from czech , many indo - aryan and iranian languages from persian , turkish from arabic ) , ' tongue ' ( a whole bunch of ethiopian languages ) , and so on . the one for which i have no completely clearly documented example is ' ear ' ( although there are cases of ' ear ' being replaced by a neologism from within the language itself ) . * * i am thus still looking for an example of borrowing involving the word for ' ear ' . * * a discussion of the whole question of borrowability of body part terms and its relation to language classification ( esp . with reference to the altaic question ) will appear in a paper by alexander vovin and me to appear next year in the zeitschrift der deutschen morgelandischen gesellschaft . finally , i would like to summarize the information provided by those who responded to my original query on linguist , to all of whom my deepest thanks : shirley silver ( silver @ sonoma . edu ) reported that mary haas , having reconstructed proto - hokan ' ear ' ( and ' navel ' ) noted that one could find or reconstruct similar forms in other language families ( penutian , yuki , and the algic languages wiyot & yurok ) , which would seem to suggest borrowing . this is the closest i have come so far to a borrowed ' ear ' . benjamin moore ( ben @ edr5r . edr . co . jp ) reports that in modern japanese , the term for animal tongue used as food is ' tan ' a borrowing of english ' tongue . ' david costa ( dcosta @ garnet . berkeley . edu ) and george aaron broadwell ( g . broadwell @ albany . edu ) note that choctaw _ nishkin _ ' eye ' ( and according to costa other forms in western muskogean ( chickasaw & choctaw , + mobilian jargon ) , are from some algonquian source ( note proto - algonquian * _ ne $ ki : n $ ekwi _ ) , a suggestion which i have found goes back at least to mary haas . however , i should add that ives goddard , whom i asked about this , expressed strong doubt about any such connection . bruce connell ( connellb @ vax . ox . ac . uk ) reported that ' heart ' in usaghade ( lower cross < benue - congo ) is apparently borrowed from a neighbouring bantu language , with semantic shift . tone marking omitted , usaghade ebuma , ' heart ' proto - bantu * - bumo , 's tomach ' . jakob dempsey ( jakob @ u . washington . edu ) reported that the common word for ' tongue ' in standard chinese and in hmong - mien languages ( generally speaking ) [ hm = miao - yao ] is very likely related , suggesting borrowing , since these languages are not considered genetically linked . norbert strade < lingnost @ hum . aau . dk > reported that the finnish word for "" neck "" , "" kaula "" , is borrowed from baltic . cynthia vakareliyska ( vakarel @ oregon . uoregon . edu ) pointed that some slavists believe that the russian word for ' eye ' ( _ glaz _ ) is borrowed from germany . ( i have been slowly tracing the origin of this opinion , which appears to be in error , but have not yet gotten all the way to the bottom of it . in my view the correct etymology , which is given by several authorities , is a shift in meaning of the native word for 's tone ' , ' boulder ' or the like ) . references from the above : connell , b . ( in press ) the role of language contact in the development of usaghade . to appear in sugia ( sprache und geschichte in afrika ) 16 or 17 , special issue on ' language contact and historical change ' . haas , mary r . 1964 . california hokan . in studies in californian linguistics . william bright , ed . university of california publications in linguistics 34 : 73-87 . jacob , betty ; t . dale nicklas ; and betty lou spencer . 1977 . introduction to choctaw . durant , ok : choctaw bilingual education program , southeastern oklahoma state university .

 i ' m sorry if this was in the original post , but it seems obvious to me that phonological misprocessing is not the only possible type of "" slip "" we could be dealing with , indeed , i do n't know the "" speech error "" literature all that well but "" fak "" for "" frank "" seems totally out as a likely error , in my view ( has anyone looked at the phonological context ? ) . surely the suspicion must be that this is a privately used slur of representative frank that crept into public discourse - - i . e . , it was a register problem rather than a phonological one . it would seem unfortunate ( just to respond to the "" political agenda "" part of an earlier post ) if we as linguists refused to bring our competence to bear on questions such as this for fear of being "" politicized "" . mark

 james , carl . ( 1998 ) . errors in language learning and use : exploring error analysis . london : longman . isbn 0 582 25763 - 8 ( paperback ) . rrp : 14 . 99 . the analysis of errors in cognitive , linguistic and other psychological processes has a long history dating back to the introduction of signal detection theory in psychophysics and behavioural learning paradigms . although many applied linguists now favour interlanguage paradigms for second-language acquisition , error analysis ( ea ) is still widely used in language classes . the attraction of ea lies in one 's ability to isolate variability in responses , such as distinguishing true errors from "" mistakes "" , which simple "" correct / incorrect "" paradigms tend to discard . in this new book on ea in language learning and usage , carl james builds on his earlier work on contrastive analysis and applied linguistics to further explore the role that performance errors play in language acquisition ( particularly second-language acquisition ) . the book consists of a historical overview of ea in applied linguistics , and then embarks on an ambitious attempt to both define and constrain the scope and methodology of ea in language processing and language learning . this methodology includes typologies for classifying and understanding how errors arise , as well as algorithmic specifications for the diagnosis and error correction in clinical and educational settings . the first chapter aims to give a historical overview of ea in the context of its origins , its inspirations , its competitors , and its influences on second language teaching . james defines an error as "" an unsuccessful bit of language "" ( p . 1 ) which seems to be as succinct and compact a description as i ' ve ever read ! however , this very readable style of writing , whilst appearing informal , is maintained through later chapters where discussion of technical issues could easily have been obfuscated by a poor writing style . first - and second-order paradigms within language learning are described in detail in this chapter , with the interlanguage and crosslinguistic approaches compared with alternatives such as ea and contrastive analysis . idiosyncratic and language-specific difficulties in language learnability are also covered in the context of linguistic change and metalinguistic influences on successful language acquisition . several methods for collecting data in ea are informally introduced in this chapter ( e . g . , error elicitations such as the "" broad trawl "" ) , which naturally leads into the second chapter on defining the scope of ea in language acquisition . the second chapter begins with an enlightening discussion of popular conceptions of what "" proper "" language is ( such as the king 's english ) , and catalogues the many failed attempts to enforce a "" correct "" dialect of english both in britain and asia ( the "" complaints "" tradition ) . this issue is clearly relevant for defining exactly what an error is , given the absolutist attributions made by some educators and policy makers about the tenability or correctness of certain forms of spoken and written english ( i . e . , "" standard "" english ) . james outlines some typologies for understanding language norms based on geographical and historical constraints , but correctly identifies deficiencies in these schemes ( particularly the failure , for example , to understand the role of colonialism in language preferences ) . this issue is taken up with respect to the issue of power and authority of native speakers with respect to non-native speakers of english , and conversely how the desire to speak a second language can unwittingly result in language loss and native - language change . chapters 3 , 4 and 5 focus on the definition and description of errors within the ea paradigm , having defined the focus of the ea methodology in the previous chapters . james begins by defining learners ' ignorance of a target language in terms of four categories of deviance : grammaticality , acceptability , correctness and strangeness . it is a clear advantage of the authors ' approach to ea that both grammatical / rational and performance / empirical approaches to language acquisition are covered by his typology , thus not "" taking sides "" with one viewpoint or the other . this rationale is based on the idea that ea is a methodology rather than a theoretical prescription . this focus continues with a discussion of error detection methods , in the context of locating and describing such errors in different parts of speech and indeed with respect to discourses longer than single sentences or phrases . the importance of a pluralistic approach which is tolerant of differences in dialects is emphasised , whilst ensuring that objective and stationary criteria are applied to utterances and writing within each dialect group . error taxonomies , such as feature and surface structure approaches , are outlined in detail with worked examples , which are one of the key design features of the authors ' pedagogical approach . computer - assisted analysis of errors is also discussed , as are specific algorithmic approaches to rating levels of error in lexical and grammatical processes . the next two chapters focus on diagnosing errors and evaluating their seriousness and impact for second-language learners in particular . possible negative influences , such as interlingual errors arising from conflicts between the target language and mother tongue , are treated in detail , as are intralingual errors and inconsistencies which the non-native speaker encounters for the first time in the target language , such as over-generalisations and false analogies . in addition , the role of culture in influencing and perhaps determining some aspects of linguistic behaviour is discussed , for example , how native speakers might "" gate "" a non-native speaker . error gravity and comprehensibility are also covered , as are some amusing examples given for "" the irritation factor "" . the sociopragmatic consequences of error production in social situations , and the potentially negative outcomes for non-native speakers , are also discussed . chapter 8 discusses pragmatic strategies for using ea to correct errors in speech and writing for second language learners . these are enhanced by a number of case studies presented in chapter 9 . the issues covered in these last two chapters are non-trivial for applied linguistics : is second - language teaching effective ? if so , which approaches are best suited to particular kinds of students ? are formal / grammatical or informal / conversational approaches superior ? although james provides no magic answers for any of these questions , he does present a coherent methodology for answering these kinds of questions for individual situations , which is the great appeal of this book . this book would be suitable as an undergraduate or graduate text in applied linguistics or tesl programmes , but will be an invaluable reference for researchers in related fields such as psycholinguistics and machine translation , who might be searching for a more formal methodology for understanding error production in their respective fields . this book will be an indispensable addition to every linguist 's library . reviewed by : paul a . watters , department of computing , school of mathematics , physics , computing and electronics , macquarie university nsw 2109 , australia . tel . : + 61 -

this is really a two fold question . let 's talk about the selling of report # 5599 first . all you have to do is place an ad , mail the postcards or send bulk email . if you place an ad send the respondent this sales letter and let this sales letter do the rest for you - no need to talk to anyone ! ! if you mail the postcards or use bulk emailing your job is done ! the postcard will ask the respondent to send $ 50 . 00 to your mailing address . email will work for you if you send it to as many people as you can . if you decide to become an offshore broker and qualify to receive over-rides and commission on the offshore business support services the parent company will do the selling for you if you wish . this is a "" no brainer "" and can be as simple or as complicated as you want to make it . . . talk to the people if you wish or do n't - report # 5599 sells itself !

 john benjamins publishing would like to call your attention to the four following titles in the field of functional linguistics : reconnecting language : morphology and syntax in functional perspectives a . . - m . simon - vandenbergen , k . davidse and d . niel ( eds ) ( univ . of gent / univ . of leuven / univ . of gent ) 1997 . xii , 212 pp . current issues in linguistic theory , 154 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 870 1 price : usd 79 . 00 rest of the world : hb 90 272 3659 3 price : nlg 158 , - - although the contributors to this book do not belong to one particular 's chool ' of linguistic theory , they all share an interest in the external functions of language in society and in the relationship between these functions and internal linguistic phenomena . in this sense , they all take a functional approach to grammatical issues . apart from this common starting-point , the contributions share the aim of demonstrating the non-autonomous nature of morphology and syntax , and the inadequacy of linguistic models which deal with syntax , morphology and lexicon in separate , independent components . the recurrent theme throughout the book is the inseparability of lexis and morphosyntax , of structure and function , of grammar and society . the third and more specific common thread is case , which in some contributions is adduced to illustrate the more general point of the link between word form on the one hand and clausal and textual relations on the other hand , while in other papers it is at the centre of the discussion . the interest of the proposed volume consists in the fact that it brings together the views of leading scholars in functional linguistics of various 'd enominations ' on the place of morphosyntax in linguistic theory . the book provides convincing argumentation against a modular theory with autonomous levels ( the dominant framework in mainstream 20th century linguistics ) and is a plea for further research into the connections between the lexicogrammar and the linguistic and extra-linguistic context . contributions by : m . a . k . halliday ; c . hagege ; robert de beaugrande ; pew sgall ; stanley starosta ; william mcgregor ; anna siewierska ; marja - liisa helasvuo ; karen e . robblee ; alice caffarel ; motoko hori . the linguistics of giving john newman ( ed . ) ( massey university , new zealand ) 1997 . xv , 373 pp . typological studies in language , 36 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 647 4 price : usd 98 . 00 pb : 1 55619 648 2 price : usd 34 . 95 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 2933 3 price : nlg 196 , - - pb : 90 272 2934 1 price : nlg 70 , - - in this collection of papers , twelve linguists explore a range of interesting properties of ' give ' verbs . the volume offers an in-depth look at many morphological , syntactic , and semantic properties of ' give ' verbs , including both literal and figurative senses , across languages . topics include : an apparent zero-morpheme realization of ' give ' in a papuan language ; noun plus causative-like suffix expressing the ' give ' concept in nahuatl ; ' give ' and other ditransitive constructions in zulu ; the complex verbal morphologies associated with ' give ' verbs in chipewyan , cora , and sochiapan chinantec ; the elaborate classificatory system found with ' give ' verbs in chipewyan and cora ; ' give ' , ' have ' and ' take ' constructions in slavic languages ; the expression of ' give ' in american sign language ; the origin of the german es gibt construction ; the extension of ' give ' to an adverbial marker in thai , khmer , and vietnamese ; the syntax and semantics of dutch ' give ' ; first language acquisition of possession terms . contributions by : john robert , david tuggy , john taylor , sally rice , eugene casad , phyllis perrin wilcox , david foris , laura janda , theo janssen , john newman , jae jung song , and michael tomasello . information status and noncanonical word order in english . betty birner & gregory ward 1998 xiv 314 pp . studies in language companion series 40 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 926 0 price : 69 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 3043 9 price : nlg 138 , - - this work provides a comprehensive discourse-functional account of three classes of noncanonical constituent placement in english - preposing , postposing , and argument reversal - and shows how their interaction is accounted for in a principled and predictive way . in doing so , it details the variety of ways in which information can be ' given ' or new ' and shows how an understanding of this variety allows us to account for the distribution of these constructions in discourse . moreover , the authors show that there exist broad and empirically verifiable functional correspondences within classes of syntactically similar constructions . relying heavily on corpus data , the authors identify three interacting dimensions along which individual constructions may vary with respect to the pragmatic constraints to which they are sensitive : old vs . new information , relative vs . absolute familiarity , and discourse - vs . hearer-familiarity . they show that preposed position is reserved for information that is linked to the prior discourse by means of a contextually licensed partially-ordered set relationship ; postposed position is reserved for information that is ' new ' in one of a small number of distinct senses ; and argument-reversing constructions require that the information represented by the preverbal constituent be at least as familiar within the discourse as that represented by the postverbal constituent . within each of the three classes of constructions , individual constructions vary with respect to whether they are sensitive to familiarity within the discourse or ( assumed ) familiarity within the hearer 's knowledge store . thus , although the individual constructions in question are subject to distinct constraints , this work provides empirical evidence for the existence of strong correlations between sentence position and information status . the final chapter presents crosslinguistic data showing that these correlations are not limited to english . the structure of the lexicon in functional grammar hella olbertz , kees hengeveld & jesus sanchez garcia ( eds . ) ( university of amsterdam ) 1998 . xii , 312 pp . studies in language companion series , 43 us / canada : hb : 1 55619 929 5 price : usd 69 . 00 rest of the world : hb : 90 272 3046 3 price : nlg 138 , - - the papers collected in this volume concern five different aspects of the role of the lexicon in the theory of functional grammar as developed by simon c . dik and his co-workers . the volume starts off with a practical introduction to the functional - lexematic model and model applications to english , german and spanish are presented . the second part of the volume deals with the derivation of action-nouns , pseudo-reflexive verbs and causative constructions , thus offering new perspectives on predicate formation within functional grammar . this is followed by a section that centers around an important problem related to valency : the question of how to account for the collocational properties of predicates . the fourth part of the book discusses ( non-prototypical ) transitive verbs and their relation to the typology of states of affairs . the final section focuses on the relationship between the lexicon and the underlying structure of the clause . check out the john benjamins web site : http : / / www . benjamins . com /

 macswan , jeff ; a minimalist approach to intrasentential code switching ; 0-8153 - 3274 - 2 , cloth ; pages 329 , $ 71 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this book explores the consequences of chomsky 's minimalist program for the data of bilingual language mixture . in the model developed , lexical items may be drawn from the lexicon of either language to introduce features into the numeration which must be checked for convergence in the same way as monolingual features must be checked ( or must not "" mismatch "" ) . the author 's proposed disjunction theorem further provides that code switching is impossible in the computation n ' since the rule ordering ( or constraint ranking ) associated with the phonological component is not preserved under union ( code switching ) . an extensive discussion shows that the analyses of previous "" constraint-oriented "" proposals may be derived from the basic feature-checking apparatus of this system . an original corpus of spanish - nahuatl code switching data is additionally presented . the work also discusses applied issues in bilingualism , touching upon assessment , tracking of minority-language students , and notions of bilingual competence and attributed language "" deficits . "" here the author contends that code switchers are exquisitely sensitive to extremely subtle requirements of both their languages , just as monolinguals are sensitive to theirs . this book will be of interest to scholars in linguistics , bilingualism , and language education . e - mail : info @ garland . com

 regarding steven schaufele 's recent posting on "" language amongst the anthropoidea , or , the racist linguist plot "" , wherein he claims never to have noticed any anti-animal "" racism "" in his training : i remember knowing about racism but not yet knowing about institutionalized racism - - wherein an institution is so permeated with racism that people are not even aware that what they say or do is racist . but let 's change the word "" racist "" to * species-ist * , since 1 ) racist does n't exactly fit cross-species issues except in the older meaning of "" human race "" , 2 ) species-ist points more clearly to our anthropocentrism , and 3 ) i no longer like to use the current concept of race because the history of its use over only the past 100 years with this particular meaning ( check the oed ) has not proven useful to me for inclusion into any explanations . dr . schaufele says , ) i certainly do n't remember anything in the introductory survey ) courses i ' ve taken myself . . . so much as hinting that it is an ) a priori assumption of the field of linguistics that language ) is the exclusive prerogative of homo sapiens . maybe the hints were all around , but never noticed . let 's next consider whether linguistics may be guilty of not overt but * covert * and institutionalized species-ism , embedded so pervasively as to be invisible to some . moonhawk 's institutionalized species - ism hypothesis predicts that unwitting species-ism will be reflected : * in textbooks through the positing of such processes as syntax and morphology ( which we claim animals do n't have ) as "" universals of language "" * in the use of metonymy ( part for whole ) to define * language * in terms of these putative universals , syntax & morphology , processes we claim only humans have , and then in calling everything else without such machinery * communication * ( which * true linguists * do n't study or publish on . ( n . b . , it 's not like you can go to a school or department of * communication * to study how animals communicate - - - so this is terminological limbo : few linguists really care what animals do ; it 's seen as irrelevant ) . * such truisms as "" there are no primitive languages "" in our intro classes - - where primitive is tacitly understood to mean "" with reduced or without the machinery of morphology & syntax "" . ( this automatically disallows what apes , cetaceans and others do from being called language , given our other claims above . ) * the omission of "" chimpanzee "" in the inventory of world 's languages * such constructs as lad ( language acquisition device ) and "" innate predisposition to language "" applied uniquely to humans . ( have you ever seen anyone positing either construct for the great apes or cetaceans ? ) * in standard theories and stories on the "" origins of language "" with exclusively human protagonists ( bow - wow and yo - he - ho theories , biblical tower of babel ) * in language acquisition classes that study primarily what humans do , with some emphasis on how humans diverge from animals just for comparison 's sake , to see how we take off developmentally from where they stop * in such phrases as "" uniquely human "" and "" social contract "" ( "" signs of the apes , songs of the whales , "" , nova , 1984 , discussing washoe 's use of asl : "" washoe has crossed the line into exclusively human territory . "" ) these are just the tip of the iceberg , off the top of the head . look around with sensitive eyes and you ' ll see the subtle signs of this species-ism everywhere . no one has to plot or say anything overtly species-ist because , given the totality of our system , animals can never break through our self-imposed cultural definitional language barrier ( as sue savage - rumbaugh so aptly notes ) . if a chimp and a child perform exactly the same behavior , the child 's is adjudged * linguistic * and the chimp 's is not , because children , unlike chimps , are said to be "" on their way to language "" ( i . e . , syntax ) . [ thanks to marilyn silva for her assistance to this point ; she thoroughly disavows any connection with what follows ! ] just so that we may see this species-ism more clearly , first a teaching i ' ve posted before , and then a brief outline for a model from a species-inclusive point of view that flows from the teaching . "" long ago , men and animals and spirits and plants all communicated in the same way . then something happened . after that , humans had to speak to each other in human speech . but we retained the old language for dreams , and for communicating with spirits , animals , and plants . "" this is what a non-species - ist ( cheyenne ) language origin story looks like - - all of nature communicating in a common way , and then * humans * moving out of that system and doing something different , the human kind of language , but remaining still connected to the original language processes whether they know it or not . wilhelm von humbolt , founder of linguistics as a university discipline , observed : "" man , regarded as an animal , belongs to one of the singing species ; but his notes are always associated with ideas . "" non - species-ist accounts are alway inclusive and evolutionary , not exclusive . and now for a model that flows naturally from the story . 1 ) we now call * language * every "" natural system "" which has utterances ( incl . sound , gesture , chemical , etc . ) combined with meaning . 2 ) we notice that as well as this sharing , humans also have differences - - different language processes that animals do n't seem to have ( morphology & syntax ) , so we call them two processes of human-specific language , the human kind of language , or just * human language * - - but we no longer designate it by merely the bare word * language * in the old exclusivist , species-ist way . this model declares that humans partake of other processes in the more inclusive * language * as well as those of specifically * human language * , so we look for similarities between humans and animals . indeed , both have motor / gestural components and spatial syntax associated with utterances and meaning , and both ( at least those with limbic systems * * * ) modulate emotions into their utterances . and , perhaps most important of the similarities , both utter idioms ! idioms are funny critters , when you think about it ; as the george foremans of the * hidden side * of linguistics - - the part of human language that does n't work by normal human language rules - - they tend to knock out every bit of morphological and syntactic machinery they encounter , not play by the rules , and consequently can help us question our culturally condoned uniqueness attitude as well . let me explain . it struck me recently , and i ' ve never encountered anyone else discussing this similarity , that the definition of idioms or formulaic speech - - utterances whose meaning cannot be pieced together from the meanings of the pieces , but must be attached to the whole utterance - - is exactly the same as the definition for any act of non-human communication you can find in the textbooks ( for bee dances , bird songs , etc . ) . in fact this definition is perhaps why non-human beings are usually said not to have ( human ) language - - because the pieces of their utterances can't be added up to make the whole meaning the way we say we can using morphology and syntax in human language . humans and animals thus intersect in * language * , in its entire evolutionary range , at most levels - - idioms , sounds , emotions , gestures ( pheromones ? ) - - and then humans only sometimes also construct new utterances from scratch . most typically we tend to use more idioms & formulaic speech with those we know well , and use it less with strangers , with whom we tend to use more formal and public speech . bees and birds and trees tend to know each other in their groups very well and can therefore be said to use idioms in their own languaging . just like us ! - - that is , unless we want to call ourselves sub-human and merely communicating , not using language , when we use idioms and formulaic speech . this move , should you accept it , irrevocably puts humans , land animals , sea creatures , trees , and maybe more , all on the same * language * map . but can these ' wild ' speculations , however evolutionarily based , actually be accomodated within a "" real "" linguistic theory ? about 15 years ago , charles fillmore was working on a unified approach i really admire ( and perhaps it 's a partial fulfillment of the reconciliation annabel cormack called for in vol-5 - 1469 on trends in lx ) , which goes something like this ( any errors are mine ) : when we are "" online "" composing / speaking , which i now must see as similar to dan slobin 's "" thinking for speaking "" mode , our process is to ' reach ' first for a handy ready-made piece of formulaic speech , and then , failing that - - lacking a ' match ' or not liking the proffered ' match ' - - we go on to construct from scratch . nature simply does n't have the further "" from scratch "" level , but shares everything to that level . fillmore 's formulation seems to fit quite nicely the picture of the evolutionary development of language ( and its synchronic effects ) that i have attempted to sketch here . ( sorry for any embarassment my use of it may have caused you , chuck ! ) the degree to which the above species-inclusive formulations may tend to disturb you quite faithfully reflects , i would guess , the degree to which you are embedded in the institutionalized species-ism so pervasive in linguistics , since these formulations are quite possibly the first truly * alternative * origins theory you have ever seen . because language and intelligence are usually linked , this more compassionate model also has the advantage of placing intelligence in nature and not so much the burden of just human beings . with this approach , linguistics could forge an academic path toward reconcilliation between western minds and nature that could provide a powerful rationale for at least slowing down , if not stopping altogether , the current ecocide , and instituting a new-though - ancient attitude of * respect * for the intelligence of nature . no linguist who sincerely wants to understand what * language * is all about can any longer afford to ignore its deeper processes in nature - - natural language , of which human natural language is an important subset . * * * anyone wishing to see how this inclusive approach further includes brainmind research - - the relevant evolution of brain structures and of brainwave rhythms - - can contact me at dalford @ s1 . csuhayward . edu . - - moonhawk ( % - ) ) ( "" the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and ) ( the eyes in his head see the world spinning round "" ) ( - - mccartney / lennon )

 does anybody know the etymology of the following currency names : rial ( iran , oman , north yemen ) riyal ( saudi arabia , quatar ) riel ( cambodia ) real ( brazil ) and maybe other similar names beginning with ri / re end ending with l ? would it be possible that those names are of the same ( ie . ) origin , originally refering to kingdom e . t . c . ( cf . regal ) ? ( what about the russian _ rubel _ , and the _ rupee _ in india e . t . c . ? ) it would , in fact , not have to be that strange to have a currency name of the same origin in countries as far away from each other as brazil and cambodia , as currency names do not seem to follow any "" national "" rules . cf . the name _ dollar _ ( in use in almost 60 countries ( comes originally from the german _ thaler _ , but has supposedly spread out under the influence of usd ) ) , and the many variations of the word "" crown "" ( icelandic kr / ona , danish krone , estonian kroon , czechish korun e . t . c ) , and _ dinar _ in various ( arabic ) countries . thanks , veturlidi oskarsson icelandic language institute reykjavmk , iceland e-mail : veturosk @ ismal . hi . is

 marilyn silva recently summarised responses dealing with "" native speaker intuitions "" , especially with respect to the sentence ' john asked mary to leave ' . she notes that several respondents pointed out that the interpretation of this sentence is determined , at least in part , pragmatically , and the view that the interpretation is syntactically fixed is wrong . this point is demonstrated by the ) pair of examples : ) ) [ 1 ] the teacher asked the child to leave the room . ) [ 2 ] the child asked the teacher to leave the room . i am a native speaker of english ( new zealand english ) , and i am not a syntactician , so i do n't think my syntax is being moulded by my , or anyone else 's , rules or theories , but , in both [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] , i can only interpret the person being asked ( the child in [ 1 ] , the teacher in [ 2 ] ) as being the person required to leave the room . no amount of ) intuition fatigue ( which could be summed ) up as "" say a weird string 50 times and it sounds good ; say a ) good string 50 times and it sounds weird "" ) has been able to change my interpretation of this kind of sentence . perhaps for some people the interpretation of this sentence * is * syntactically determined . the summary concludes with : ) in his post to me , carson contends that judgment data "" can ) provide real , useful data , if we would just be more systematical ) and careful about how we collect them . of course speakers will ) differ on certain points . . . . the interesting question is whether ) the range of variation we find is systematically constrained in ) ways that interesting theories of grammar can explain . "" i agree that ( native ) speakers will differ on certain points - - my syntax probably differs from that of most people , and i think this is probably typical ( in my case the following ( a ) sentences are ungrammatical and would normally be the ( b ) sentences : 1 . ( a ) i promised mary to leave . ( b ) i promised mary i would leave . 2 . ( a ) candidates are recommended to obtain the booklet . ( b ) it is recommended that candidates obtain the booklet . 3 .

 i recently asked about whether one says ' who ' or ' what ' to ask what variety of animal in contexts such as : a . a person walks into a room with a swollen arm . you say : ' wh - bit you ? ' or b . you see an animal disappearing into the woods . you say : ' wh - is that ? ' the following languages ( thanks to the people listed for the info ) seem to use ' what ' only , although in context a gave some of the respondents did not like either alternative . greek ( a speaker who wished not to be identified by name ) finnish , swedish ( jussi karlgren ) english , hebrew ( david gil ) dutch , french ( bert peeters ) georgian ( ivan derzhanski ) german ( john peterson ) norwegian , swedish ( marit julien ) danish ( soren harder ) i would add polish to this list , based on my own judgements . ivan derzhanski adds bulgarian to the list , his testimony being particularly valuable , since he feels a clear contrast between bulgarian and russian here , but greg gouzev says that he would use ' who ' in context a ( but not b ) . on the other hand , dale russell reports that in cheyenne : "" people are all animate , but so are rocks , trees and leaves ( but not branches ) and the sun . animals are all animate , so far as i know . some body parts are animate , roughly those that are voluntarily movable . noses are not animate , fingers are . if you point to a rock and ask "" what is this ? "" , a native speaker will correct you , and say "" who is this ? "" , then answer the question - - at least that was my experience , in a field-methods type language learning experience . "" jonathan bobaljnik reports that itel ' men sometimes uses ' who ' and sometimes ' what ' for referring to animals . unfortunately , there 's very little data on the language , so i can't be very specific about the conditions determining which you get when . the clearest example of a language that uses ' who ' is russian ( in a striking contrast to closely related polish and bulgarian ) , as stated in standard works on this language and confirmed to me by alex eulenberg , ari solovyova , and ivan derzhanski ( but i must add that daniel radzinski reports that at least one speaker he spoke with gave different judgements ) . i find particularly interesting the fact that russian linguists working on other languages routinely note this difference between russian and whatever language they are describing ( i have seen this probably dozens of times in russian grammars or dictionaries of various languages of the former empire ) . barbara abbott noted a reference i had missed : chomsky 's in _ current issues in linguistic theory _ ( mouton , 1964 ) , p . 40 , notes that we cannot say "" what is eating its dinner ? ( the cat or the dog ) "" , and that ' who ' is also not natural in that context . a lot of the respondents indicated similar difficulties in other languages . i have not kept track of these , but they include french , danish , etc . , as noted by various respondents ( including frank gladney on english ) . cathy ball says that older forms of english sometimes use ' what are you ? ' in addressing a human being . special thanks to osten dahl who first pointed out to me that you have to define very particular contexts for this question , since in many contexts many lgs allow neither ' who ' nor ' what ' . alexis manaster ramer

 thanks to all who responded to my request for grepping under a dos environment with the following syntax : < grep - r < fn1 > < fn2 > fn3 > < where fn1 is the file with the set of strings to be grepped > < fn2 is the data-base > < fn3 is the output . > with the suggestions and help that i have got , i have literally "" grepped "" all about grep . thanks a lot i got a whole lot of answers which i am summarising below : 1 . the first was to use perl script to write my own grep : for both unix and dos , perl is a language that will easily allow to create a small program that will do what you ask . more information about perl , including free downloads for many environments , can be gotten from the perl language home page , http : / / www . perl . com / perl / index . html . 2 . the second suggestion was similar in nature : use awk and lex tools for the job . 3 . under unix environment three types of grep were proposed : a . egrep egrep - f fn1 fn2 > fn3 where fn1 is a file containing the search patterns ( one per line ) . if you only want to search for literal strings ( no special characters ) then you can use fgrep instead of egrep . do ' man grep ' for more details , b . fgrep fgrep - f patt-file - name < database-to - search > results-file will work , assuming patt-file - name is a file of _ strings _ ( regular expressions containing metacharacters are not allowed by fgrep . ) say man fgrep to get the details . one hitch however it will only match strings , not regular expressions . c . sgrep the sgrep utility ( not standard unix ) permits complex ( and nested ) patterns to be searched for . 4 . under dos the gnu tools are now available under dos ; gnu has only one grep and lets you do this ( according to the manual ) with grep - f f1 f2 > f3 this works and i have used it with success . thanks to andreas mengel incidentally egrep , sgrep and fgrep versions for dos exist and can be found at : ftp . rediris . es / mirror / simtelnet / gnu / gnuish / grep15 . zip thanks to susana sotelo docio 5 . another suggestion was to use sed sed - n - f < file > permits many patterns to be searched for ( with some problems when multiple matches occur on a line . 6 . another solution under dos was to grep for a large number of strings at once in a ` regular expression ' . a second alternative was to batch-file the operation , which i am using at present as a solution , but wanted something more functional . 7 . a commercial solution was also proposed : mks ( mortice - kern ) in canada makes a commercial set of unix apps and commands for use in dos and windows environments , including ksh , awk , grep , gres . their grep syntax is : grep - f pattfile file > output _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ many thanks to : martin wynne < eiamjw @ comp . lancs . ac . uk > will dowling < willd @ spectranet . ca > kevin bretonnel cohen < kevin @ cmhcsys . com > mark liberman < myl @ unagi . cis . upenn . edu > john e . koontz koontz @ boulder . nist . gov peter hamer < p . g . hamer @ nortel . co . uk > stuart luppescu < s-luppescu @ uchicago . edu > stephen p spackman < stephen @ softguard . com > d . lee < d . lee @ lancaster . ac . uk > chris culy < cculy @ blue . weeg . uiowa . edu > david palmer < palmer @ linus . mitre . org > shravan vasishth < vasishth @ ling . ohio-state . edu > susana sotelo doc ' io "" < fesdocio @ usc . es > andreas mengel < mengel @ babylon . kgw . tu-berlin . de > for their prompt and helpful replies to my query .

 coling - acl ' 98 workshop multilingual information management : current levels and future abilities august 16 , 1998 universite de montreal montreal / canada the coling / acl workshop on multilingual information management is a follow-on to an nsf - sponsored workshop held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation in granada , spain ( may 1998 ) . the goal of the workshop was to consider the recent history and likely near-term future of a number of research areas pertaining to language that are related ( but still semi-independent at present ) . the conclusions have been gathered into a report , to be submitted to the nsf , le , and other funding agencies in europe and north america , for their consideration in setting funding policies and goals . the draft report is now available at http : / / www . cs . cmu . edu / ~ ref / mlim / at the granada workshop , an international panel of invited experts focused on a set of questions in an attempt to identify the most likely and most effective future directions of computational linguistics research - especially in the context of the need to handle multi-lingual and multi - modal information . the coling workshop , a follow-on , has the aim of opening the discussion to the computational linguistics community as a whole , to solicit the comments , additions , feedback , and contributions of everyone . to register , consult the coling / acl home page at http : / / coling-acl 98 . iro . umontreal . ca / workshop description the development of natural language applications which handle multi - lingual and multi-modal information is the next major challenge facing the field of computational linguistics . over the past 50 years , a variety of language-related capabilities has been developed in areas such as machine translation , information retrieval , and speech recognition , together with core capabilities such as information extraction , summarization , parsing , generation , multimedia planning and integration , statistics-based methods , ontologies , lexicon construction and lexical representations , and grammar . the next few years will require the extension of these technologies to encompass multi-lingual and multi-modal information . extending current technologies will require integration of the various capabilities into multi-functional natural language systems . however , there is today no clear vision of how these technologies could or should be assembled into a coherent framework . what would be involved in connecting a speech recognition system to an information retrieval engine , and then using machine translation and summarization software to process the retrieved text ? how can traditional parsing and generation be enhanced with statistical techniques ? what would be the effect of carefully crafted lexicons on traditional information retrieval ? the workshop is organized as a series of discussion sessions , each one devoted to one aspect of computational language , initiated by a report of the discussions at the granada workshop ( a report summarizing the discussions at granada is available ; see below ) . enough time for discussion has been scheduled . the discussion will focus on the following fundamental questions : 1 . what is the current level of capability in each of the major areas of the field dealing with language and related media of human communication ? 2 . how can ( some of ) these functions be integrated in the near future , and what kind of systems will result ? 3 . what are the major considerations for extending these functions to handle multi-lingual and multi-modal information , particularly in integrated systems of the type envisioned in ( 2 ) ? in particular , we will consider these questions in relation to the following areas : o multi-lingual resources ( lexicons , ontologies , corpora , etc . ) o information retrieval , especially cross-lingual and cross-modal o machine translation , of text and speech o automated ( cross-lingual ) information extraction and summarization o methods and techniques ( both statistics-based and linguistics-based ) o speech recognition and synthesis o multimedia communication , as well as language and speaker identification o evaluation and assessment techniques for each of these areas o government policy for future funding the initial findings of the report will form the basis of the discussion . the draft report is now available at http : / / www . cs . cmu . edu / ~ ref / mlim / major points raised in the discussions will be recorded and included in the report . we eagerly seek your feedback , comments , contributions , and assistance , to make this report as comprehensive and as accurate as possible ! program 9 : 00 - 9 : 10 welcome and overview 9 : 10 - 9 : 55 cross - lingual and cross - modal information retrieval moderator : judith klavans 9 : 55 - 10 : 40 information extraction and automated text summarization moderator : eduard hovy 10 : 40 - 11 : 00 break 11 : 00 - 11 : 45 methods and techniques moderator : nancy ide 11 : 45 - 12 : 30 machine translation of text and speech moderator : bente maegaard 12 : 30 - 2 : 00 lunch 2 : 00 - 2 : 45 multilingual resources moderator : martha palmer 2 : 45 - 3 : 30 speech recognition and synthesis moderator : tba 3 : 30 - 4 : 00 break 4 : 00 - 4 : 45 evaluation and assessment moderator : john white 4 : 45 - 5 : 30 multimedia communication and language / speaker identification moderator : oliviero stock 5 : 30 - 6 : 00 government : development policy and funding moderator : antonio zampolli the report the outcome of the granada and montreal workshops is a report , originally commissioned by the nsf , to be submitted to the nsf , le , and other funding agencies in europe and north america . the first draft of the report is available at http : / / www . cs . cmu . edu / ~ ref / mlim / we eagerly seek your feedback , comments , contributions , and assistance in making this report as comprehensive and as accurate as possible ! organizers robert frederking center for machine translation carnegie - mellon university schenley park pittsburgh , pa 15213-3890 tel : + 1-412 - 268-6656 fax : + 1-412 - 268-6298 email : ref @ nl . cs . cmu . edu eduard hovy information sciences institute of the university of southern california 4676 admiralty way marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 tel : + 1-310 - 822-1511 fax : + 1-310 - 823-6714 email : hovy @ isi . edu nancy ide department of computer science vassar college 124 raymond avenue poughkeepsie , ny 12604-0520 usa tel : + 1-914 - 437 5988 fax : + 1-914 - 437 7498 email : ide @ cs . vassar . edu joseph mariani limsi-cnrs bp 133 91403 orsay cedex france tel : + 33 - 1-69 - 85-8085 fax : + 33 - 1-69 - 85-8088 email : mariani @ limsi . fr antonio zampolli ilc-cnr via della faggiola 32 56100 pisa italy fax : + 39-50 - 556285 email : pisa @ ilc . pi . cnr . it - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - eduard hovy email : hovy @ isi . edu usc information sciences institute tel : 310-822 - 1511 ext 731 4676 admiralty way fax : 310-823 - 6714 marina del rey , ca 90292-6695 project homepage : http : / / www . isi . edu / natural-language / nlp-at - isi . html

( if you > do n't i ' ll say "" i thought not ! "" ) i suppose i ' m taking up benji 's gage , though i want it understood that i ' m very much in sympathy with what he has to say . i remember a little over 10 years ago i was taking a course in lexical phonology , and got into an argument with the prof . because he insisted that one of the co - rollaries of the theory was that ' people ' is inherently plural , which explained the non-existence of the overt plural ' peoples ' . i insisted that the word ' peoples ' certainly does exist and that therefore any theo - retical claim that it does n't was ipso facto falsified . ( cf . rev . vii 9 : ' a great multitude which no one could number , from every nation , from all tribes and * peoples * and languages ' . now , presumably ' people ' in this passage means something like ' ethnic group ' , and is not therefore precisely equivalent to ' people ' meaning ' many persons ' , or ' the set of all human beings ' . i would also note that one common meaning of ' universe ' is ' the set of all existing things ' , which would also imply that the word ' universes ' ought not to exist either , but it does . for one thing , there is a variant usage of ' universe ' which makes it roughly synonymous with ' galaxy ' or ' group of galaxies ' , of which of course there are many . it is also freely used in talking about ' parallel universes ' , etc . ) > from a paedagogical point of view i think it is perfectly legitimate for a linguistics teacher to say , ' here 's a bunch of strings , with attendant grammaticality judgments . what generalizations can we draw from these data ? ' we can save ourselves from the threat of the protest of a student who happens to be fluent in the language under discussion against a gram - maticality judgment by invoking the notion of ' idiolect ' and claiming ' these judgments are an accurate reflection of one particular individu - al 's own linguistic behaviour . what can we deduce about the internalized grammar of that individual ? ' this , of course , assumes that what we as linguists are concerned about is language as a psychological / cognitive phenomenon , and i believe that that is legitimate . but we are also , in my opinion legitimately , concerned about language as a social phenomenon . in which case language is not ( simply ) the property of an individual mind but of a community , and ' gram - maticality judgments ' may be different at the communal level from the individual level . i think as teachers we need to be honest with our stu - dents about this , which means allowing ourselves the luxury of a certain type or level of judgment on one occasion and a different one on another , but as much as possible each time making it clear to our students what level we ' re working at . addressing the broader issues that have come up following joseph stemberger 's posting in linguist 5-1163 , i think we also need to make clear the difference between ' grammaticality ' and ' acceptability ' judg - ments . i have an introductory lecture , prepared for a course i have as yet had no opportunity to teach , in which i attempt to explain that a given string ( e . g . , ' 3 is angry ' or ' my toothbrush is pregnant ' ) may be perfectly grammatical but semantically or pragmatically anomalous , and might be rejected for that reason , while another string ( e . g . , ' tooth - brush my am orange ' or ' there are a rabbit in garden ' ) may be fully in - terpretable and therefore not semantically anomalous but nevertheless violate certain constraints of grammar . i would be inclined to reject any claim that , as georgia green occasionally put it ( facetiously ) in class and elsewhere , ' the rules of grammar must include the rules of arithmetic and all other real-world knowledge ' . thus , if my son were to say , ' the moon is made of green cheese ' i might challenge him on the * content * of his statement , but not on its * con - struction * . dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *

 i ' ve been enjoying the discussion of words that are their own antonyms . at first i thought the classic example of latin altus "" high "" or "" deep "" might fit in , but as i thought about it i figured it was just unmarked for point of view ( say when cleaning out an empty swimming pool then "" deep "" becomes "" high "" ) so i just looked to see if it was on the list and got a comment . no . good . but one that i have long wondered about is "" risk "" as in "" he risked winning the game "" . i was shocked ( as a teenager ) the first time i saw "" he risked losing the game "" ( or something like that ) in print , because i previously thought ( and am still inclined toward ) the complement of risk being the desirable result , not the undesirable one . whether or not this fits into this discussion , i wonder if anyone else has had a similar ( or opposite ) reaction or any thoughts about what 's going on in the case of "" risk "" . benji

427,1718,"Subject: subcategorization in tranformational grammar
 
 dear colleagues , i ' m wondering if someone could give me some pointers to the latest literature in transformational grammar ( gb , p&p , minimalism ) that deals with issues of subcategorization . in particular i would like to get a sense of the latest thinking , including ways in which minimalism departs from previous assumptions . among the questions that i would ideally like to see addressed are the following : - what kind of subcategorization relations have been assumed in the recent literature , and for what kinds of phenomena ? for instance , a transitive verb must somehow encode the requirement of taking a dp complement . but can a verb also take a pp complement according to the identity of that pp 's head ( as in _ rely _ + _ on _ ) ? - how are subcategorization relations constrained ? that is , what syntactic ( or semantic ) properties are thought to be accessible ( in the limit ) to the selecting head ? - if there are substantive formal constraints on subcategorization , where do they come from ? is there anything in the architecture of the theory from which such constraints would follow ? thanks very much , - - andreas kathol

 on february 27 , i posted a querry on expletive negation in modern hebrew . i want to thank ariel cohen ( ariel _ cohen @ riga . mt . cs . cmu . edu ) , michael ephratt ( rhlh702 @ uvm . haifa . ac . il ) , bob fradkin ( raf100f @ oduvm . cc . odu . edu ) , laurence horn ( lhorn @ yalevm . cis . yale . edu ) , paul rowlett ( p . a . rowlett @ mod - lang . salford . ac . uk ) and lucia tovena ( tovena @ latl . unige . ch ) for their comments . my querry originated from michael moore 's comment to the effect that in modern hebrew , the sentence negation of subordinate clauses dominated by before , until and i ' m afraid can be interpreted referentially or expletively . according to ariel cohen , only until contexts allow an expletive negation . bob fradkin mentionned that expletive negation in mh seemed less frequent than in french . while it seems that expletive negation in mh has a narrower domain of use than in french , there might also be a question of style involved here ; while expletive negation is an aknowledged grammatical feature of formal style in french , it might be a non-standard feature of mh . this is suggested to me by the fact that neither glinert 1989 suggested by michael ephratt nor rosen 1977 even mention expletive negation in mh . lucia tovena pointed me to her 1994 paper in geneva generative papers about italian , hungarian and hindi expletive negation in until contexts . for a typological overview of expletive negation , one can consult horn 1978 , which shows the typological extension of the phenomenon . now , i ' m still left with a few unanswered questions . i ' m surprised that there apparently does n't exist any study on the topic in mh . i wonder whether i should be looking in the direction of ancient hebrew . a question of more general interest is how to deal with divergent distributions of a phenomenon across languages ; in other words , how should the fact that expletive negation exists in comparative and fearing contexts in a large number of languages but not in mh ? ? could matters of style , as suggested above , explain this ? ? thanks for those who responded and for those who will . - glinert , l . , 1989 , the grammar of modern hebrew , cambridge up . - horn , l . , 1978 , some aspects of negation , j . greenberg , universals of human language , vol . 4 , standford up , 127-210 . - moore , m . , 1992 , double negation , et cetera , 304-309 . - rosen , 1977 , contemporary hebrew . pierre larrivee departement de langues et linguistique , universite laval , quebec , canada , g1k 7p4 3914larp @ vm1 . ulaval . ca

 in response to poser , nichols does on p . 6 of her book claim that there is no way for the comparative method to distinguish between nostratic and "" a much larger grouping of most lineages of the old world and new world "" , that is , as she herself says , between hypothetical groupings of around c . 12000 and c . 40000 years ago , and she does say that this "" because the cut-off point is so shallow "" , the cut-off point being the ceiling of 6000-10000 years which she imposes ( wihout any basis , as noted in my earlier messages ) on the comparative method . since this amounts to a rejection of the nostratic hypothesis ( not as false perhaps but as unverifiable / unfalsifiable , i guess ) , this means that i am right and poser is wrong about whether there have been people who have rejected particular theories of linguistic relationship on the basis of this mythical ceiling idea . in response to teeter : i think ( and i hope karl will endorse this ) that our disagreements are really quite minor , but they are real as far as they go . for example , while karl is obviously 100 % right about meillet 's position in the scientia article ( where meillet says that lexical comparisons can never prove a relationship , and only morphological ones can ) , in his 1925 book meillet repeatedly states that you can establish a linguistic relationship purely on the basis of lexical correspondences , makes the same point that i have been making over and over again here on linguist that for some language families this is the only way of showing relationship since they lack morphology , and even makes the same point that i did about how certain things can only be done once you have established , at least tentatively , that the languages you are dealing with are related . as a matter of fact , he even shows how you could demonstrate the relatedness of the romance languages purely on the basis of a lexical comparison , using the numerals 1-10 , and then shows how you could do that for the older indo - european languages too ( although there he begins to slip in a little morphology ) . i would also like to add that i think it is a serious mistake to pretend that there are no models for comparative linguistics besides indo - european , because it is so utterly atypical of the language families of the world . there are plenty of equally well established families , several of which are older in the only sense that matters , that is , not in years before the present but in years before the earliest written records and many of which are more useful models for those working on families not yet established ( afroasiatic , austronesian , austroasiatic , uto - aztecan , altaic , etc . ) . which is not to say that there is anything wrong with knowing as much as possible about ie , but rather that there is much wrong with knowing naught but indo - european . i am not sure but i think that this is what eric hamp had in mind in a recent paper in the davis / iverson volume when he complained about how the teaching of historical linguistics is hampered by textbooks which largely draw their material from ie ( or indeed from some favored parts of it , such as romance ) . and i am happy to have sally thomason point out that morphological elements can be borrowed . meillet we must remember was greatly troubled by the possibility of such a thing and of the existence of mixed languages . he tried to debunk every examples around , and thought ( wrongly i think ) that if such languages exist , then they cannot be handled by the comparative method . the fact that such languages do exist ( e . g . , mitchif ) and yet pose no problem ( so that we have no trouble tracing certain parts of mitchif to french and others to cree ) means that meillet was worried for naught . but it also means that language classification on the basis of morphology is no more infallibible than that on the basis oif lexical material . you work with what you have available , which in some cases may be largely morphology and only a few obvious lexical parallels ( that 's how afro - asiatic was first established ) , morphology and lexicon ( indo - european ) , lexicon and a single morphological parallel ( algic , as victor golla reminded me just the other day ) , lexicon only ( vietnames and the rest of mon - khmer ) , and so on and so forth .

461,632,"Subject: lx as * science * ?
 
 i accept the editors ' recent challenge for resuming last year 's thread ( which i missed , before subscribing ) on whether linguistics is / should be considered a science - - by which i am assuming everyone means newtonian * science * rather than the quantum / relativity science which has been current during this century . [ n1 ] . i will argue 1 ) that while much of our work is * scientific * , much of our work goes beyond the traditional definitions of * science * ; 2 ) that being categorized solely as * science * is to our long-term professional detriment ; 3 ) that we are uniquely positioned to aim higher . academics over the centuries have used various prestige words when desiring to assert their rigor . * scientific * is such a word today , and has been a prestige word since the early 1800 's when it replaced * philosophical * as the term academics use when indicating some ultimate in rigor and truth . and well before that , in seventh-century rome , boethius and others used * logical * as their prestige word . [ n2 ] i ' m confident this is not the sole reason for most linguists ' claim that linguistics is a * science * . but for those few for whom it is : saying it 's * rigorous * is sufficient to describe that side of our work . perhaps instead our discipline is looking for professional prestige and advancement in academe , and aligning politically with * science * is seen as the best strategic move . [ n3 ] is this a reason ? if so , perhaps we can talk together about it out loud rather than it remaining as a professional assumption . but there are other reasons we might consider giving up * science * as a label - - including our unique perversity in cultivating the process of working with meaning . a physicist friend once told me that if physics had to deal with the dimension of meaning ( s ) as well as everything else it deals with , physics could no longer be a science . [ greg derry , personal communication ] . newtonian physics was long held as the model of hard * science * , and all of its principles exclude ( d ) meaning . but so do the principles of 20th - century physics . is any linguist ready to give up meaning ( including the systemic meaning of structure ) in order to be * scientific * ? is linguistics not at least as much art as science ? can anyone provide me a good reason for categorizing linguistics as science in the context of these remarks ? is n't there something more inclusive we can aim toward ? but where 's our model in the social / soft sciences ? actually , linguistics is the best potential candidate for such a new , meaning-full model of science . other disciplines have been watching us for decades . after all , we train in our methodologies for a very delicate balancing act in consciousness between form and meaning ( i . e . , when doing historical work , we compare forms even from other languages , but we can't stop with that - - we must also be aware whether they have changed semantic categories , etc . ) . this is what some in other disciplines would call a systems approach , which goes beyond modern structuralism [ n4 ] . like the complementarity principle in physics , form and meaning in linguistics are complementary ( not polar ) opposites , both necessary for the total system to work properly . alas , our own theories are another matter . because of the terminological shackles of a meaning-less * science * that some would place on our discipline , we continue to use the dead metaphors of that meaning-less * science * in our attempts at meaning-full theory building . [ n5 ] notice how we have historically treated those who urged us to move our theories to the level of our methodology - - to the level of systems thinking : which describes a world of uncertainties and mutual interdependencies rather than mono-certain anything ; or chaotic ' attractors ' pulling events toward them into material manifestation [ n6 ] , instead of one thing directly causing another . whorf took one step , in transforming einstein 's relativity principle from the more limited geometry focus to the larger focus of human language in general , which he called the linguistic relativity principle . [ n7 ] that physics has in this century been dealing with deep linguistic questions has unfortunately been lost on most linguists . and the deeper mergers of language and philosophy have been ignored for universalist perspectives in the latter half of this century [ n8 ] . and linguistics departments are closing as the rest of academe ruthlessly renders its own self-serving judgement : linguistics is becoming irrelevant , a "" pseudo-science "" , in the late 20th - century . please understand : i am in no way against the * scientific * mode of linguistics - - it is uniquely appropriate to studying form . it is not , however , appropriate to studying meaning , for obvious reasons . the answer is not to let the part overwhelm the whole such that our entire discipline becomes * scientific * , but to accept the challenge and develop theories and principles of a meaning-full science that other disciplines will so admire that in the 21st century they will start claiming to be * linguistic * as a way of claiming ultimate rigor in their search for truth . * * * * notes : [ n1 ] i assume this because of the way all the social sciences treated whorf , who was attempting to tell them that the very definition of * science * / science was changing underneath their certainties . if it were otherwise , we would n't need this discussion . [ n2 ] dineen on boethius : "" logic became the prestige study of the day , the medieval 's most precise and respected intellectual tool . it held the same position in the intellectual world then that science holds now : serious study today must be 's cientific ' - - then it had to be ' logical ' "" . [ n3 ] however , as one christian de quincy wrote recently , "" [ m ] ost scientists do not recognize the limits of science , nor do they want to . there is a power given to the society that supports science . if one were to take the power and possession [ of science ] away from the corporations and politicians , what would be the standing of science in society ? "" [ n4 ] . . . and what some consciousness anthropologists would call a 's hamanic stance ' , balancing with a foot in both worlds . eastern philosophers would probably talk about the interpenetration of yin and yang within the tao , as david bohm found out in his dialogues with j . krishnamurti . [ n5 ] including such pre - relativity / quantum * scientific * vocabulary as ' cause ' and 'd etermine ' ( especially when linked , as in monocausal determinism ! ) . we even try to project these dead * metaphors onto people using systems thinking ( e . g . , sapir , whorf , pike , lamb ) . [ n6 ] per current chaos theory in mathematics , for those who like to use mathematics in their linguistics theories . [ n7 ] einstein also had the larger language issues in mind , which he talked about in a 1941 radio speech ( "" what is it that brings about such an ultimate connection between language and thinking ? . . . the mental development of the individual and his way of forming concepts depend to a high degree upon language . this makes us realize to what extent the same language means the same mentality . "" ) . [ n8 ] there is so much more that needs to be done in interesting areas such as how reason and logic and philosophy grow out of the grammars of languages . most are not aware , for instance , that the word ' karma ' - - long before it was a term of eastern philosophy denoting the process of what goes around comes around with emphasis on the ' comes around ' experiential phenomena - - was a term within the system of sanskrit linguistics meaning 'd irect object of verb ' [ james ryan , sanskrit & philosophy scholar , personal communication then presentation at society for the anthropology of consciousness , 1992 ] . what might a well-articulated philosophy of animacy from native american languages look like ? - - moonhawk ( % - > ) < "" the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and > < the eyes in his head see the world spinning round "" > < - - john lennon >

 in a number of lgs ( roviana and yup ' ik eskimo being the two in which i have encountered this ) , nonreferential np 's are phonologically and / or morphologically / syntactically incorporated into the vrb / verb phrase / verb group . are there any similar structural clues which could be used to identify nonreferential np 's in english ? my interest is in identifying nonreferential np 's in written english so that a computer natural lg processing system would know not to set up referents for them to serve as antecedents for subsequent anaphora resolution . compounds ( e . g . duck-shooting season ) can i suppose be treated superficially as single words , but what about things like ' lose faith in ' , ' catch sight of ' . of course , some criteria will involve larger discourse issues , but it may be that it is possible to identify at least some nonreferential np 's "" cheaply "" , i . e . just by looking within a clause and / or considering inherent lexical semantics . i will summarize and post any replies to this list . regards , simon corston .

470,891,"Subject: summary : chomsky 's "" single mutation ""
 
 a couple of weeks ago i posted a query about an alleged quotation from chomsky . the quote came from gordon hewes , an anthropologist and a specialist in language origins , in his 1977 paper ` language origin theories ' in duane rumbaugh 's book _ language learning by a chimpanzee _ , on page 43 . there hewes asserts that chomsky has explicitly attributed the human language faculty to a single genetic mutation in one of our ancestors . the source was given as "" chomsky ( 1967 ) "" , but no such item appears in hewes 's bibliography , nor indeed any works by chomsky at all . i therefore asked if anybody could point to such a statement in chomsky 's works . i received seven responses , most of them from people who either know chomsky personally or who take a professional interest either in chomsky 's work or in language origins . no one was aware of any such statement by chomsky , either in print or elsewhere , and a couple of people flatly disbelieve that chomsky has ever said any such thing . i myself have tracked down and read all of chomsky 's 1967 publications which might be relevant , and i can find no such suggestion in any of them , though two of them do make passing remarks on language origins . i have also skimmed through chomsky 's books _ cartesian linguistics _ ( 1966 ) , _ language and mind _ ( 1968 , 1972 ) and _ knowledge of language _ ( 1986 ) without finding any such statement ( though i have n't read them carefully ) . it appears , then , that chomsky has made no such suggestion , and that hewes 's statement must result from some kind of error or misunderstanding . i find this odd , though , since hewes is well known as a specialist in language origins and since the remark occurs in the middle of a generally well-documented survey of earlier suggestions on the origin and evolution of language . most peculiar . my thanks to keith mccormick , robert freidin , scott delancey , vivian cook , rich hilliard , massimo piattelli - palmarini , and raf salkie for their helpful responses . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk

"" well , i had 196 orders for = report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march = 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 packets , i received $ 58 , 000 with more = coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . = 20 always follow the guarantee , 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in about = 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! "" threw it away "" "" i had received this program before . i threw it away , but later wondered if i should n't have given it a try . of course , i had no idea who to contact to get a copy , so i had to wait until i was emailed another copy of the program . eleven months passed , then it came . i didn ' t throw this one away . i made $ 41 , 000 on the first try . "" dawn w . , evansville , in "" no free lunch "" "" my late father always told me , ' remember , alan , there is no free lunch in life . you get out of life what you put into it .

"" alan b . , philadelphia , pa a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing = invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who = never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of = the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get = poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you = to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have = ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . = it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of = this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the = more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money !

! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , now very legal , money making opportunity . it does = not require you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and = best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level email order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . email is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is = being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and = 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at erris mail order marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use = $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a now perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not = involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , = store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) = 20 to the person listed for the specific report . international = = 20 orders should also include $ 2 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous = 20 money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders !

the bank software that come with a solid database to help you manage your clientele and your fees , and the check writing module that allows you to download check files from the bank and print reatime refunds checks to your clients ; the eepp communication module that makes the transmission of your clients ' return information to the irs as easy as pressing a button ; and finally the eepp windows interface that seamlessly integrates all those valuable goodies in one piece of software . all this for only $ 596 . 00 . no royalty fee to pay , no adversing fee . all the profits are yours to keep . but we still think that an initial investment of $ 596 . 00 in a business you do n't know about may constitute a string significant enough to hold you back . so , to facilitate the entry to new subscribers we pay up to $ 397 . 00 off your first year eepp software package . leaving you with an initial investment of $ 199 . 00 . we are some kind of millionaires who are just giving money away , nor are we going to pretend that we are in this just to help you . no . we are in it just like you to make money . and we make money only when you make money . all the details you might need to understand how the electronic filing program and the eepp offer work are posted on the eepp web site . all the forms and applications you need to sign up , and make payment for subscription fee over the internet are also available on line . but , you will agree with me , if that site was advertised on the giant search engines , the information it contains would not be so valuable because the information it contains would become public domain . your prospective clients could access the same information that makes your business worth what it 's worth . if time is money , business is information . and that is why we give access to the eepp site to people who really mean to be in business . for the web address , and your partner id number ( pidn ) , just reply to this message ( by clicking on the reply to the author icon , if you are using microsoft internet explorer ) , or direct your inquiry and questions to tax _ biz _ 4 _ u @ hotmail . com , call in your inquiry at ( 407 ) 895-2306 . but why pay a phone call when it 's free to email ? do n't wait any longer . some of the discounts are available in limited quantity only .

"" that motivated me to prepare the appended item . please feel free to pass it around . tony woodbury * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * counting eskimo words for snow : a citizen 's guide lexemes referring to snow and snow-related notions in steven a . jacobson 's ( 1984 ) yup ' ik eskimo dictionary [ 1 ] anthony c . woodbury university of texas at austin july 1991 this is a list of lexemes referring to snow and related notions in one eskimo language , central alaskan yupik ( or just yup ' ik eskimo ) . it is spoken by about 13 , 000 people in the coast and river areas of southwestern alaska from norton sound to bristol bay . it is one of five eskimo languages . ( of these five , probably the best-known is inuit , spoken in a series of well-differentiated dialects ranging from northern alaska , all across the canadian far north , and up to the coast of greenland . while the term inuit is preferred to eskimo by many in canada , the term is retained here because ( a ) it properly refers to any eskimo group , not only the inuit ; and ( b ) its use is widespread in native communities in alaska . ) this is a list of lexemes rather than of words . roughly , a lexeme can be thought of as an independent vocabulary item or dictionary entry . it 's different from a word since a lexeme can give rise to more than one distinctly inflected word . thus english has a single lexeme _ speak _ which gives rise to inflected forms like _ speaks _ , _ spoke _ , and _ spoken _ . it 's especially important to count lexemes rather than words when talking about eskimo languages . that 's because they are inflectionally so complicated that each single noun lexeme may have about 280 distinct inflected forms , while each verb lexeme may have over 1000 ! obviously , that would put the number of snow words through the roof very quickly . the list is organized according to lexeme * meanings * . perhaps somewhat arbitrarily i have counted fifteen of them , placing within each of them noun and / or verb lexemes having the same basic sense . and perhaps even more arbitrarily , i ' ve grouped these fifteen meanings into four larger sets . but the most arbitrary decision of all is left to the discretion of the reader-the decision of how to count the lexemes themselves . here are some of the problems you face : ( a ) are all fifteen lexeme meanings really 's now ' - meanings ? that is , do words with these meanings really count for you as words for snow ? [ 2 ] ( b ) there are some synonyms present - - alternative lexemes with the same meaning , like garbage vs . trash in english . are you going to count them separately , or together ? ( c ) if you decided to count synonyms together , will you also count together both of the members of noun-verb pairs having basically the same meaning ? ( the members are , technically speaking , separate lexemes since partly idiosyncratic morphological changes mark the verbal forms , and must therefore be listed separately in any truly informative dictionary , as indeed jacobson 's dictionary does . ) ( d ) following jacobson , i ' ve specially labelled those lexemes that only occur in a small subpart of the central alaskan yupik - speaking region . are you going to try to make counts for each separate dialect ? if yes , you will wonder if you really have enough information to do so .
